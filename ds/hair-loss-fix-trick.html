    <div class="_4V5eas4P _qf6Xn7Uy">
        <p>Hi, my name is Jim McHenry.</p>
<p>If you're<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> losing your hair</span>, or you are worried about losing your hair&hellip;</p>
<img src="images/custom/revifol-img-1.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
<p>You are five minutes away from the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">biggest breakthrough of your entire life.</span></p>
<p>Because you're about to realize that the hair you've lost&hellip;</p>
<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Isn't really lost at all.</span></p>
<p>You just thought it was, because you didn't know the truth.</p>
<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">And the truth will set you free</span>, as you'll see.</p>
<p>If you're here<span class="_IeEc8YIm"> it means you're hurting</span>. Something just isn't right with the world.</p>
<p>When your hairline first crept back a bit you didn't think much of it.</p>
<p>And when clumps of hair were showing up in your comb you ignored that too.</p>
<p>This was just a natural part of getting older, right?</p>
<h2>But then it got worse&hellip;.</h2>
<p>And you actually started to see a <span class="_IeEc8YIm">different person</span> in the mirror. A person
    <span class="_IeEc8YIm">you didn't like anymore</span>.</p>
<p>You began to feel like you were losing control as months and years went by. Like your good looks were being robbed from you before your very eyes.</p>
<p>You don't stand as tall as you used to now. </p>
<p>You can sense eyes upon you... <span class="_MIe9sLtV">judging you </span>wherever you go.</p>
<p>You look years older.</p>
<p>The girls don't look at you the same way; and deep down you know, neither does your wife.</p>
<p>You went from studly to nerdy and then to pathetic; and all it took was the loss of a few hair follicles. </p>
<p>You keep wondering when it would stop.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">But it won't stop, until everything is gone.</span></p>
<p>Your confidence drops by the day. Your very identity is shaken.</p>
<p>"Am I really the man I used to be?"</p>
<p>"Will my spouse ever see me the same way?"</p>
<p>"Will I ever see myself the same way?"</p>
<p>You find yourself at a crossroad.</p>
<p>Everyone you trust is telling you should accept it, shave your head and go on with your life. </p>
<p>But for many of you, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">not graced with the stunning scalp of a Mr. Clean,</span> that's just not an option.</p>
<p>Before you found this page, you've probably looked at
    <span class="_IeEc8YIm">countless other products</span> - pills, potions and creams, noticing that they were either too expensive or too time consuming; and none had promise of long term results.
</p>
<img src="images/custom/revifol-img-2.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">And dark hopelessness is setting in.</span> You don't know if it will ever go away&hellip;</p>
<p>If any of this rings true for you, I just have one thing to say.</p>
<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">It isn't your fault.</span></p>
<p>It really isn't.</p>
<p>You along with hundreds of millions of other men, are suffering from the exact same problem, thinking the exact same thoughts.</p>
<p>And are coming to realize the exact same thing.</p>
<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">None of this crap you're being offered actually works&hellip;</span></p>
<p>Excuse my French.</p>
<p>If you feel as if you've wasted your time and wasted your money, <span class="_IeEc8YIm">I hate to say it</span>.</p>
<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">But you have.</span></p>
<p>I'm a hair restoration expert and believe me&hellip;</p>
<p>All my patients use Rogaine and Propecia. It's not like they haven't heard of it.</p>
<p><span class="_IeEc8YIm">They use it every day</span>.</p>
<p>And yet they're still in my office with a head as bald as a golf ball, ready to go under the knife to fix this problem.</p>
<p>I thought I was doing them a service by cutting them up.</p>
<p>I really thought that. </p>
<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Until one day.</span></p>
<p><span class="_IeEc8YIm">A day that changed me forever.</span></p>
<p>I realized it just doesn't have to be that way.</p>
<p>I realized that a problem that seemed out of our control, was actually very much in our control.</p>
<p>
    <span class="_MIe9sLtV">And the 8.4 billion dollar hair industry that's cashing in this most difficult time of your life, instead of curing us&hellip;</span>
</p>
<p>They don't even attempt to offer a cure to this condition, a condition which is in many ways
    <span class="_IeEc8YIm">destroying our lives... by the millions</span>.</p>
<p>I will admit.</p>
<p>The products they offer us may have some results for a little while.</p>
<p>But are they the complete solution?</p>
<p>How long do these results actually last?</p>
<h2>Here's a little secret they don't want you to know.</h2>
<p>Try to find someone still using Rogaine successfully after 5 years.</p>
<p>Try to find them and you'll see, they just don't exist.</p>
<p>And they know it.</p>
<p>And they continue to sell it, <span class="_IeEc8YIm">even though it isn't a real solution</span>.</p>
<p>If you don't believe me, call up Rogaine's customer service right now and ask them if this product is a cure for hair loss.</p>
<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">They will be forced to admit the truth. That is not.</span></p>
<p>The dirty truth is, <span class="_IeEc8YIm">they don't want a cure</span>.</p>
<p>Because if your hair loss is cured, there is nothing for them to sell you month by month,
    <span class="_MIe9sLtV">that will fill their deep, greedy pockets.</span></p>
<img src="images/custom/revifol-img-3.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
<p>And by the way, that kind of thinking is what's at the head of many medical problems we face today.</p>
<p>
    <span class="_MIe9sLtV">The medical industry is no longer interested in cures, </span>because you only pay for a cure once, but their products make them money for life.
</p>
<p>That's why there's so much talk of a cure for everything from chicken pox to yellow fever, but
    <span class="_IeEc8YIm">no cure for hair loss&hellip;</span></p>
<p>Sure, hair loss isn't lethal, but per capita it causes as much suffering as any of these diseases. </p>
<p>But now&hellip;</p>
<p>If you aren't mad enough, <span class="_IeEc8YIm">I'm going to send your blood boiling&hellip;.</span></p>
<p>
    <span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">What if I told you they aren't looking for a solution to hair loss because there is already a solution to hair loss&hellip;</span>
</p>
<p>And that solution has been known to the hair care industry for over 9 years.</p>
<p>And yet this solution hasn't made it into any of their products&hellip;</p>
<p>Or been covered in a single article anywhere online.</p>
<p><b>This solution was right here the entire time. And it's almost free.</b></p>
<p>So I gathered together a team of scientists, who were friends of mine and we developed a cocktail of the ingredients that not only help create this effect in powerful and rapid ways…</p>
<p>But what we wound up with is what we call <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> a super cocktail of the ingredients that supercharge all the hair follicles growth cycles.</span></p>
<p>So it works fast, and generates far higher quality hair that lasts longer. This is the cocktail of hair regrowth.</p>
<p>And the craziest part is…</p>
<p>Until today…</p>
<p><b>Nobody in the world has ever heard of it.</b></p>
<p>And it all happens because we put this solution inside a supplement capsule, an all natural solution that anyone can take at home.</p>
<p>We called it</p>

<h2>Revival</h2>
<div class="_oGw3aBom _3n5s4LH6">
    <img src="images/products/prod1/1-bottle.png" style="max-width: 240px;">
</div>
<h2>This solution has helped thousands already.</h2>
<p>A product like no other because it gets to the root of the problem, it's all natural and it's one time which means you won't have to buy anything else from us again.</p>
<p>You cannot find a hair regrowth product that has all these benefits.</p>
<p>Because it simply doesn't exist.</p>
<p>
    <span class="_IeEc8YIm">We are the first to bring this to market</span>, and by the looks of it, we'll be the only ones for quite some time.
</p>
<p>So now it's time to ask yourself.</p>
<p>One year from now, who do you want to be?</p>
<p>Do you want to be the person <span class="_IeEc8YIm">still trying to figure out how to make a believable comb-over</span>?</p>
<p>Or do you want to be the person being hit on by others half your age?</p>
<p>The one who's spouse gets giddy to see when you come home, or the one still trying to find a good hat to hide behind?</p>
<p>And when I talk about these dreams, they really aren't dreams at all&hellip;</p>
<p><span class="_IeEc8YIm">These are real results</span>, as I'll explain in a moment.</p>
<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">This is really happening.</span></p>
<p>A new era in your life is about to begin. Greater than what you've ever experienced before.</p>
<p>You will have every person you know burning with envy and crowding around you like you're a celebrity asking how you did it.</p>
<p>But <span class="_IeEc8YIm">you will be the only one</span> who knows the secret.</p>
<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">The secret solution to hair loss.</span></p>
<p>Now there is one thing that may worry you - you might be wondering about the price of this product.</p>
<p>So let me just turn that question back to you.</p>
<p>What would you be willing to pay to know you'd never need to worry about your hair falling out again?</p>
<p>Really think about that.</p>
<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Would you pay $500? $1,000?</span></p>
<p>Personally I would pay more.</p>
<p>Any sane man would.</p>
<p>This is your self esteem we're talking about here.</p>
<p>So could I charge that much?</p>
<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Absolutely.</span></p>
<p>And I'd have people lining up.</p>
<p>But the truth is, I'm not here to make myself money.</p>
<p>I'm retired and I'll be just fine.</p>
<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">I'm here to make an impact.</span> I'm here
    <span class="_IeEc8YIm">to make a dent in an industry filled to the brim with lies and misinformation</span>.</p>
<p>And I'm here to create another success story for my portfolio.</p>
<p><span class="_IeEc8YIm">Your success story</span>.</p>
<p>So even though industry experts are telling me that it's easily a $397 product.</p>
<p>We decided to charge half of that...</p>
<p>Bringing the price down to $197.</p>
<p>But then I decided I don't want anyone to miss out because of the price and we both know times are tough, especially these days with all the things going on in the world.</p>
<p>So <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> is now&hellip;</p>
<p>Just $97.</p>
<p>But hold up.</p>
<p>Because during the first days of our online launch, we are allowing you to get in at an <span class="_MIe9sLtV">even lower price.</span></p>
<p>Bringing you down to <span class="_MIe9sLtV">$67 </span>for a bottle of Revival.</p>

        <p>That's because of our
            <span class="_MIe9sLtV">special guarantee</span>, which is unlike any guarantee you'll ever get from any hair care product in the industry.
        </p>
        <p>They would simply go out of business if they had to defend this guarantee.</p>
        <p>That means you have <span class="_MIe9sLtV">60 days to try our product.</span></p>
        <p>And after 60 days, if you don't see the results you're looking for, or you want your money back for any reason at all, you don't have to explain yourself. </p>
        <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">You get your money back in your account with no questions asked.</span></p>

<p>So take your time with this product.</p>
<p>Give it a try and show it to others you trust, so you can decide for yourself that Revival is the right thing for you.</p>
<p>Because we don't keep anyone's money unless we've fully given you the results we promise.</p>
<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">No red tape. No hoops to jump through.</span></p>
<p>You have my word on that.</p>
<p><span class="_IeEc8YIm">I take your trust in me very seriously</span>.</p>
<p>I will make sure <span class="_MIe9sLtV">you succeed.</span></p>
<p>Which is why we also provide top notch around the clock customer service and expert support for life.</p>
<p>To help you through every aspect of this process.</p>
<p>We're coming to a close and <span class="_MIe9sLtV">it's time for you to make a decision.</span></p>
<p>You have a simple choice to make.</p>
<p>You can do nothing.</p>
<p>
    <span class="_IeEc8YIm">And your hair along with your confidence will keep fading</span>, like an old picture of Michael J. Fox in Back to The Future.
</p>
<p>And your life, in general.</p>
<p>Will continue on a <span class="_MIe9sLtV">downward slide.</span></p>
<p>Your spouse will no doubt find you less and less attractive as time goes on. And the same thing will be true for any other people you have in your life.</p>
<p>You can go down that road.</p>
<p>Or you can choose to join thousands of people who are
    <span class="_IeEc8YIm">growing their hair right now,</span> and loving every minute of it.</p>
<p>They have bright faces and bright futures.</p>
<p>Futures that look up, not down.</p>
<p>In my opinion, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">you deserve to be part of that.</span></p>
<p>I believe it's time you take your life back. It's hard enough as it is, without a big bald spot on top of it.</p>
<p>This may come shocking, but I'll tell you this. </p>
<p>If you don't do this, a year from now, when you look in the mirror at a naked scalp, and your spouse has lost any interest in you&hellip;</p>
<p>You're going to think back to this video.</p>
<p>And you're going to know that things could've been different.</p>
<p>Growing your hair back is <span class="_MIe9sLtV">a great blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="_IeEc8YIm">It's up to you to bring that blessing into your life.</span></p>
<p>It's easy when I show you the way. All it takes is a small investment today, that will pay dividends for the rest of your life.</p>
<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">So make your decision.</span></p>
<p>Here's what you need to do to get started.</p>
<p>Select the 6 bottle package or any package you want, click the order button below and secure your order.</p>
<p>Fill in the details on the next page and we'll rush
    <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival </span>directly to your home in just a few days from now.</p>
<p>So click the button now and secure your package.</p>
<p>And together,<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> let's get that hair back.</span></p>
<p>And if you have any doubts, here's the answer:</p>
<p>Don't say yes.</p>
<p>Just say maybe.</p>

    <span class="_MIe9sLtV">If you want to know what it's like to be the only person with a full head of hair growing even in their 70s, then do it now.</span>
</p>
<p>You'll never know how much hair you could have grown back if you don't try.</p>
<p>Click the button, fill your details on the next page and I'll see you on the other side.</p>
<p>I know there's that little voice inside of you saying &ldquo;push this off to another day&rdquo; or &ldquo;I just don't know if it's for me&rdquo;. It's the same voice that has kept you from all your dreams.</p>
<p>There's always tomorrow.</p>
<p>Or when I have money. Or when I feel like it.</p>
<p>Well you know something?</p>
<p>I've learned that the perfect moment will never come. <span class="_MIe9sLtV">The moment of success is a moment YOU need to create.</span></p>
<p>And I believe that for you, this is the moment. If you don't do this now, next time when you come back to this page, this video might be forever gone.</p>
<p>And you've seen the results.</p>
<p>You'll never find a product that gives you the results like this one, no matter how far and hard you look. </p>
<p><span class="_IeEc8YIm">This is meant to be</span>.</p>
<p>You came to this page for a reason. Not just to spend 20 minutes watching a video and leaving. So make this experience meaningful.</p>
<p>Take a chance on your new hair. If you risk nothing, you get nothing.</p>
<p>And here, there's really no risk at all. </p>
<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">So hit that button now.</span></p>
<p>Hit it well and fill out the form.</p>
<p>And I'll see you on the other side with a very special announcement.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Sometimes the only reason someone hasn't hit the button is because they have a few questions that need answering.</p>
<p>So let's do that right now.</p>
<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">QUESTION #1: How does Revival work?</span></p>
<p>As I explained in the video, scientists have found that the root cause of hair loss is a steroid called DHT. This steroid is a compound of your testosterone and increases in value as you get older.</p>
<p>When its levels increase, it clogs your hair follicles and stops your hair from growing. The reason its values get high is because of an enzyme called 5-ARD.</p>
<p>To suppress this enzyme your body requires certain vitamins and minerals.
    <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> is the right choice as it contains the perfect balance you need to inhibit 5-ARD and get your hair back.
</p>
<p>Revival is an all natural solution to hair loss. </p>
<p>So go ahead and secure your <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> package now.</p>

        Revival is only available for purchase on this website
    </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">QUESTION #2: Is Revival safe to use if I have allergies?</span></p>
<p>We created this amazing natural solution to hair loss so that it has no damaging side-effects on people who have a variety of common allergies, because the quantities of the ingredients inside are carefully selected to be below the allergy-triggering levels.</p>
<p>We recommend that if you have any known allergies to one of the mentioned ingredients, you do not take this supplement.</p>
<p>For more details please check the disclaimer link at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">QUESTION #3: Why haven't I heard of this solution before?</span></p>
<p>This solution has been buried for years by the 8.4 billion dollar hair care industry. If the actual way of regrowing your hair would be released to the public, it would cost them hundreds of millions in losses.</p>
<p>That's why you need to hurry and secure your package today. We are being constantly harassed by the cabals of this industry to take this video down of the internet.</p>
<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">QUESTION #4: Is Revival for everyone?</span></p>
<p>Yes.
    <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> works for anyone, no matter what your hair condition is and age; it doesn't matter if you're 20 years old or 70 years old.
</p>
<p>Go ahead and give it a try now.</p>
<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">QUESTION #5: I'm in. What's next?</span></p>
<p>Select your 6 bottles package or any other package, click the order button, fill in the shipping details and your order will soon be shipped to you.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Got more questions?</p>
<p>As soon as you get inside, 95% of them will be answered.</p>
<p>And there is really no cost to get you in when you can get your money back at any time. </p>
<p>So hit the button below now and fill out the form.</p>
<p>Oh and for the other 5% of the questions we might not answer? For that we have experts standing by ready and waiting for your support request. You can ask them anything under the sun about hair loss, the supplement, your order and more. </p>
<p>You will have a knowledgeable, articulate, friendly and satisfying response within 24 hours or less.</p>
<p>So, in summary, the historic Revival is a click away right now.</p>
<p>I've risked a lot and give a lot of myself to bring it to you. And you won't need to pay a penny for it unless you want to.</p>
<p>But it's up to you to make it.</p>
<p>Don't wait.</p>
<p>You have a simple act in front of you right now, that could cause the biggest change in your time that you ever had.</p>

    <p>This website (“Website”) is the property of <span class="_MIe9sLtV">folliclerevival.com</span> (“we,” or “us”). We respect our user’s privacy, and we understand the importance of the information you entrust to us. This Privacy Policy describes our practices concerning the information we collect from you when you visit and use our Website.</p>
    <p>Among other things, this policy describes the types of information we collect when you visit our website or utilize any of its functions, how we use and protect that information, how long we retain it, and with whom we share it. It also explains what your rights and options are as they pertain to that information. By visiting this website or using our Service, you consent to our collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>This policy is incorporated into and made a part of our Terms of Service.</p>

    <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">1. GDPR Compliance Statement:</span> Pursuant to the terms of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and is the “Data Controller” with respect to all of the information collected from visitors to our Website and users of our Service. To ensure compliance with the GDPR, we have incorporated the following practices and procedures:</p>
    <p>(a) We verify that the third parties with which we share User information are GDPR compliant;</p>
    <p>(b) We ensure that data is stored in a manner that facilitates our ability to locate and delete information pertaining to a specific user upon request;</p>
    <p>(c) The manner in which we use the information we collect are limited to those discussed in this Privacy Policy;</p>
    <p>(f) If we modify any of the terms of this policy, we inform all of our Users; and</p>
    <p>(g) We have appointed an internal Data Protection Officer who is responsible for overseeing our privacy and data protection procedures and will serve as the individual point of contact for information access and deletion requests.</p>

    <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">2. Information We Collect.</span> We collect two basic types of information from our Users:</p>
    <p>(a) Personal Data:</p>
    <div class="pl-32">
        <p>(i) What is Personal Data? Personal Data is information that pertains to you specifically, and can help identify you as a person. We collect Personal Data from you whenever you complete a contact form on our website, including your name, email address, phone number, country, city, state, and zip code. You may also provide us with additional Personal Data in any email messages you send to us, or in the form of user forum posts or chats.</p>
        <p>(ii) When and How do we collect it? We collect Personal Data from Users when: (1) they submit a contact form on our website; (2) initiate an online chat with us; or (3) submit a post to our User forum. In addition, when you visit our Website we will record your IP address and/or unique mobile device identifier. Under ordinary circumstances, an IP address recorded in isolation is not Personal Data under the standard definition of the term. However, it may become Personal Data when it is combined with other information, such as an email message.</p>
        <p>(iii) How do we use Personal Data? We use Personal Data to communicate with you and respond to your requests. We may also use your email address to send you account related notices and promotional marketing materials. We use your IP address to identify your location in order to provide you with notices and other information that may be required by your local regulatory authority.</p>
        <p>(iv) Where is Personal Data Stored? All Personal Data collected from Users outside and within the United States will be transferred and to and stored on the Amazon Cloud.</p>
    </div>

    <p>(b) General Information:&nbsp;&nbsp;General Information consists of information that is anonymous in nature and does not identify you as an individual. &nbsp;This includes your computer IP address, unique mobile device identifier, browser type, ISP or carrier name, and the URL of the last web page you visited before visiting our website. This information gives us insights on how our users use our site and our other products. We collect this information by using “cookies”, which are small bits of computer code that are transferred to your computer’s hard drive via a web browser, which enable us to record the general information described above. We use this information to ensure that our service continues to appeal to our users.</p>
    <p>(i) How do we use General Information?&nbsp; General Information gives us insights on how people use the Service, and helps us to maintain, modify, and enhance it.&nbsp;We use cookies to help us customize your experience when using the Service. We also use services provided by <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.hotjar.com/38sa=D38ust=1585933040236000" target="_blank">Hotjar</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookies-user-id38sa=D38ust=1585933040237000" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.facebook.com/38sa=D38ust=1585933040237000" target=")blank">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.zendesk.com/company/policies-procedures/38sa=D38ust=1585933040237000" target="_blank">ZenDesk</a>, which set cookies for each User when they visit our site or use our Service. &nbsp;</p>
    <p>(ii) Where is General Information Stored? All General Information collected from Users outside and within the United States will be transferred and to and stored on servers located in the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/38sa=D38ust=1585933040238000" target="_blank">Amazon Cloud</a>.</p>

    <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">3. How We Share information.</span> We will not share Personal Data with third parties for marketing purposes without your consent. We will share Personal Data with certain third parties in the following ways:</p>
    <p>(a) Service Providers: &nbsp;We utilize the following third-party service providers to perform certain functions on our behalf and must share certain information (including Personal Data) with them in order for them to do so. However, the information that is shared is limited to that which is necessary to perform their specific functions: &nbsp;</p>
    <p>(i) Amazon Web Services&nbsp;hosts our website (<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/38sa=D38ust=1585933040239000" target="_blank">click here</a>&nbsp;to view their privacy policy);</p>
    <p>(ii) ZenDesk&nbsp;provides us with customer support and chat services (<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.zendesk.com/company/policies-procedures/38sa=D38ust=1585933040240000" target="_blank">click here</a>&nbsp;to view their privacy policy):</p>

    <p>(b) Law Enforcement:&nbsp; If requested or required by law enforcement authorities, courts, or regulators, we may disclose any information we have about our users. We also may disclose your Personal Data to exercise or protect legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>
    <p>(c)&nbsp;Bulk Asset Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these business transfers, customer information, including Personal Data, is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if all or substantially all of our business assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or enter into bankruptcy, customer information (including your Personal Data), would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any assets may continue to be used according to your Personal Data as set forth in this policy.</p>
    <p>(d)&nbsp;Other Third Parties:&nbsp;We may reserve and have the right to disclose any information about you or your use of our Service without your prior permission, if we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company or its affiliates, other Users of the Service or the public.</p>

    <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">4. How We Protect Information.</span> We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the data we collect against unauthorized or unlawful access and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. We also limit access to User information to employees who reasonably need access to it in order to do their jobs. However, because no security system can be 100% effective, we cannot completely guarantee the security of any information we may have collected from or about you. In addition, we have no control over the security of other web sites that you might visit even when a link may appear to those web sites site from our Site. If you share your computer or use a computer that is accessed by the general public, remember to log off and close your browser window when you have finished your session.</p>

    <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">5. How Long We Keep Information.</span> We retain Personal Data and General Information for as long as necessary to fulfill a business purpose or comply with a legal request. We may also choose to anonymize certain elements of the information you provide to us so that it can no longer be attributed to you if we would like to retain it for longer periods of time. You may also request that we delete your information in the manner described in Section 6.</p>

    <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">6. Your Options and Rights.</span> We currently offer Users the following options with respect to the manner in which we collect, use, and maintain information, or to otherwise exercise their rights under applicable privacy statutes:</p>
    <p>(a)&nbsp;All Users:&nbsp; You may request that we stop sending you non-account related emails by clicking the “unsubscribe” link that is included at the bottom of non-account related emails. You may also request that we delete the information we collected from and about you by contacting our Data Protection Officer. You may also request that we not share your Personal Data with one or more of the third parties we share it with. Be advised, however, that this may limit or prevent you from using our Website.</p>
    <p>(b) EU Citizens:&nbsp;If you are an EU citizen, you may request that we provide you with (or delete) all the information we collected from and about you, or otherwise exercise your rights under the GDPR by contacting our Data Protection Officer. Data reporting and deletion requests will be processed free of charge within thirty (30) days.</p>
    <p>(c) California Residents:&nbsp; Under the California Online Privacy Protection Act (“CalOPPA”), if you are a California Resident you may request information regarding the types of Personal Data we share with third parties for direct marketing purposes, and the identities of the third parties with whom we have shared such information during the immediately preceding calendar year. You may request further information about our compliance with CalOPPA by contacting our Data Protection Officer. Please note that under CalOPPA, we are only required to respond to one request per User each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through requests submitted to our Data Protection Officer.</p>

    <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">7. Tracking Technology and Do-Not-Track Requests.</span> We employ certain applications that may enable us to track your online activities over time and across third-party web sites. We honor Do-Not-Track requests transmitted by Web browsers.</p>

    <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">8. Children under 13.</span> Our Website is not intended for users under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 18. If we become aware that a person submitting information is under 18, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.</p>

    <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">9. Modifications to this Privacy Policy.</span> We reserve the right to amend, alter, or otherwise change this Privacy Policy at our sole and absolute discretion. If we modify this Privacy Policy, we will notify all Users by a pop-up on our website. Further use of the Website following any such change constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">10.

        limited to, any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to your
        use of the Website. Any such dispute shall be determined by arbitration to be held
        in Palo Alto, California before one arbitrator. Any party to an arbitration
        proceeding may appear remotely by telephone or Internet. The arbitration shall be
        administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures.

                <p class="_MIe9sLtV">All Affiliate advertising must NOT include content that is deceptive, misleading, untruthful, unsubstantiated, or otherwise fails to comply with applicable federal and state consumer protection laws, regulations, and guidelines. All affiliates (regardless of their country of domicile) MUST be in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines, including without limitation the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”), the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (“CAN-SPAM Act”), Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) regulations and guidelines implementing the FTC Act and the CAN-SPAM Act, the FTC’s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising (“FTC Testimonials Guide”), the National Advertising Division decisions of the Better Business Bureau, and other federal and state consumer protection laws, regulations, and guidelines.</p>
    <p>Affiliates are NOT permitted to use ANY of <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> before and after photos, or user testimonials in their promotions. Affiliates may not bid on <span class="_MIe9sLtV">“Revival”</span> based keywords, use the term <span class="_MIe9sLtV">“Revival”</span> in any pay per click ads, use any terminology in ads or landing pages that are similar to ‘scam’ or ‘fraud’, or create customer incentives for purchasing <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> (through cash rebates or 3rd party bonus offers – NO BONUSING!).</p>
    <p>Affiliates must also NEVER use any full or part of images or videos (including our sales and promotional video) that they do not own (unless given permission by this website), and are forbidden from using any imagery that would imply any personal endorsement (celebrity or otherwise) without written consent from both the individuals making the endorsement and <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span>.</p>
    <p>Affiliates must NEVER link directly to our checkout pages, our discounted checkout page, nor the discount sales page. All affiliate traffic must pass through our website. Affiliates must never attempt to sell our product at a discount. This includes creating discount offer pages linking directly to the checkout. Any affiliate caught doing this practice will be blacklisted immediately. All affiliate traffic MUST come through our sales page.</p>
    <p>Affiliates are forbidden from creating web pages, social media pages or accounts that falsely represent themselves as the creators or owners of <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> product and must make it clear that the page is a review page. It is strictly forbidden to create apps for sale or for giveaway using <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> brand. You are also not allowed to create any other products using our brand name, for sale or for giveaway (in other words – no free reports, books, workouts, or apps branded with our brand name whatsoever). In short, do not represent a product created by you or someone hired by you as ours.</p>
    <p>You are not allowed to promote <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> on retail sites, auction sites, or app stores such as Amazon, eBay, Google Store, iTunes, or any other site that falls into these categories, in any way, shape, or form (this includes products created by you or by us). As well, selling products branded with <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> brand on Craigslist, Kijiji, or any other classified ad network is forbidden.</p>
    <p>Affiliate agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> from any lawsuits, investigations, claims, or complaints arising from any such violation or alleged violation of the terms above. <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> shall not be responsible to approve any Affiliate Ads. Compliance is solely with the Affiliate and the Affiliate represents and warrants that it shall have legal review of all Affiliate Ads for all necessary and required compliance. Affiliates take full responsibility for their advertising.</p>
    <p class="_MIe9sLtV">Any affiliate caught breaking any of these terms will be banned immediately without hesitation, and will not be eligible for reinstatement.</p>

                    How does Revival work?
                </div>
                <div class="_zIjjj5bU">
                    <p>As I explained in the video, scientists have found that the root cause of hair loss is a steroid called DHT. This steroid is a compound of your testosterone and increases in value as you get older.</p><p>When its levels increase, it clogs your hair follicles and stops your hair from growing. The reason its values get high is because of an enzyme called 5-ARD.</p><p>To suppress this enzyme your body requires certain vitamins and minerals. Revival is the right choice as it contains the perfect balance you need to inhibit 5-ARD and get your hair back.</p><p>Revival is an all natural solution to hair loss.</p><p>So go ahead and secure your Revival package now.</p>

We respect our user’s privacy, and we understand the importance of the information you entrust to us. This Privacy Policy describes our practices concerning the information we collect from you when you visit and use our Website.</p>
    <p>Among other things, this policy describes the types of information we collect when you visit our website or utilize any of its functions, how we use and protect that information, how long we retain it, and with whom we share it. It also explains what your rights and options are as they pertain to that information. By visiting this website or using our Service, you consent to our collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>This policy is incorporated into and made a part of our Terms of Service.</p>

    <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">1. GDPR Compliance Statement:</span> Pursuant to the terms of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and is the “Data Controller” with respect to all of the information collected from visitors to our Website and users of our Service. To ensure compliance with the GDPR, we have incorporated the following practices and procedures:</p>
    <p>(a) We verify that the third parties with which we share User information are GDPR compliant;</p>
    <p>(b) We ensure that data is stored in a manner that facilitates our ability to locate and delete information pertaining to a specific user upon request;</p>
    <p>(c) The manner in which we use the information we collect are limited to those discussed in this Privacy Policy;</p>
    <p>(f) If we modify any of the terms of this policy, we inform all of our Users; and</p>
    <p>(g) We have appointed an internal Data Protection Officer who is responsible for overseeing our privacy and data protection procedures and will serve as the individual point of contact for information access and deletion requests.</p>

    <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">2. Information We Collect.</span> We collect two basic types of information from our Users:</p>
    <p>(a) Personal Data:</p>
    <div class="pl-32">
        <p>(i) What is Personal Data? Personal Data is information that pertains to you specifically, and can help identify you as a person. We collect Personal Data from you whenever you complete a contact form on our website, including your name, email address, phone number, country, city, state, and zip code. You may also provide us with additional Personal Data in any email messages you send to us, or in the form of user forum posts or chats.</p>
        <p>(ii) When and How do we collect it? We collect Personal Data from Users when: (1) they submit a contact form on our website; (2) initiate an online chat with us; or (3) submit a post to our User forum. In addition, when you visit our Website we will record your IP address and/or unique mobile device identifier. Under ordinary circumstances, an IP address recorded in isolation is not Personal Data under the standard definition of the term. However, it may become Personal Data when it is combined with other information, such as an email message.</p>
        <p>(iii) How do we use Personal Data? We use Personal Data to communicate with you and respond to your requests. We may also use your email address to send you account related notices and promotional marketing materials. We use your IP address to identify your location in order to provide you with notices and other information that may be required by your local regulatory authority.</p>
        <p>(iv) Where is Personal Data Stored? All Personal Data collected from Users outside and within the United States will be transferred and to and stored on the Amazon Cloud.</p>
    </div>

    <p>(b) General Information:&nbsp;&nbsp;General Information consists of information that is anonymous in nature and does not identify you as an individual. &nbsp;This includes your computer IP address, unique mobile device identifier, browser type, ISP or carrier name, and the URL of the last web page you visited before visiting our website. This information gives us insights on how our users use our site and our other products. We collect this information by using “cookies”, which are small bits of computer code that are transferred to your computer’s hard drive via a web browser, which enable us to record the general information described above. We use this information to ensure that our service continues to appeal to our users.</p>
    <p>(i) How do we use General Information?&nbsp; General Information gives us insights on how people use the Service, and helps us to maintain, modify, and enhance it.&nbsp;We use cookies to help us customize your experience when using the Service. We also use services provided by <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.hotjar.com/38sa=D38ust=1585933040236000" target="_blank">Hotjar</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookies-user-id38sa=D38ust=1585933040237000" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.facebook.com/38sa=D38ust=1585933040237000" target=")blank">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.zendesk.com/company/policies-procedures/38sa=D38ust=1585933040237000" target="_blank">ZenDesk</a>, which set cookies for each User when they visit our site or use our Service. &nbsp;</p>
    <p>(ii) Where is General Information Stored? All General Information collected from Users outside and within the United States will be transferred and to and stored on servers located in the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/38sa=D38ust=1585933040238000" target="_blank">Amazon Cloud</a>.</p>

    <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">3. How We Share information.</span> We will not share Personal Data with third parties for marketing purposes without your consent. We will share Personal Data with certain third parties in the following ways:</p>
    <p>(a) Service Providers: &nbsp;We utilize the following third-party service providers to perform certain functions on our behalf and must share certain information (including Personal Data) with them in order for them to do so.

    <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">4. How We Protect Information.</span> We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the data we collect against unauthorized or unlawful access and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. We also limit access to User information to employees who reasonably need access to it in order to do their jobs. However, because no security system can be 100% effective, we cannot completely guarantee the security of any information we may have collected from or about you. In addition, we have no control over the security of other web sites that you might visit even when a link may appear to those web sites site from our Site.

    <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">6. Your Options and Rights.</span> We currently offer Users the following options with respect to the manner in which we collect, use, and maintain information, or to otherwise exercise their rights under applicable privacy statutes:</p>

    <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">7. Tracking Technology and Do-Not-Track Requests.</span> We employ certain applications that may enable us to track your online activities over time and across third-party web sites. We honor Do-Not-Track requests transmitted by Web browsers.</p>

        administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures.

        extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor

        affected his settlement with the debtor."

        the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of

    <p>Affiliates are NOT permitted to use ANY of <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> before and after photos, or user testimonials in their promotions. Affiliates may not bid on <span class="_MIe9sLtV">“Revival”</span> based keywords, use the term <span class="_MIe9sLtV">“Revival”</span> in any pay per click ads, use any terminology in ads or landing pages that are similar to ‘scam’ or ‘fraud’, or create customer incentives for purchasing <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> (through cash rebates or 3rd party bonus offers – NO BONUSING!).</p>
    <p>Affiliates must also NEVER use any full or part of images or videos (including our sales and promotional video) that they do not own (unless given permission by this website), and are forbidden from using any imagery that would imply any personal endorsement (celebrity or otherwise) without written consent from both the individuals making the endorsement and <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span>.</p>
