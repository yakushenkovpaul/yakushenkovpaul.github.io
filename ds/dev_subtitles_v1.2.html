					<p>Hi, my name is James Connor.</p>
	<p>If you're<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> losing your hair</span>, or you are worried about losing your hair&hellip;</p>
	<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/custom/revifol-img-1.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
	<p>You are five minutes away from the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">biggest breakthrough of your entire life.</span></p>
	<p>Because you're about to realize that the hair you've lost&hellip;</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Isn't really lost at all.</span></p>
	<p>You just thought it was, because you didn't know the truth.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">And the truth will set you free</span>, as you'll see.</p>
	<p>If you're here<span class="_IeEc8YIm"> it means you're hurting</span>. Something just isn't right with the world.</p>
	<p>When your hairline first crept back a bit you didn't think much of it.</p>
	<p>And when clumps of hair were showing up in your comb you ignored that too.</p>
	<p>This was just a natural part of getting older, right?</p>
	<h2>But then it got worse&hellip;.</h2>
	<p>And you actually started to see a <span class="_IeEc8YIm">different person</span> in the mirror. A person
			<span class="_IeEc8YIm">you didn't like anymore</span>.</p>
	<p>You began to feel like you were losing control as months and years went by. Like your good looks were being robbed from you before your very eyes.</p>
	<p>You don't stand as tall as you used to now. </p>
	<p>You can sense eyes upon you... <span class="_MIe9sLtV">judging you </span>wherever you go.</p>
	<p>You look years older.</p>
	<p>The girls don't look at you the same way; and deep down you know, neither does your wife.</p>
	<p>You went from studly to nerdy and then to pathetic; and all it took was the loss of a few hair follicles. </p>
	<p>You keep wondering when it would stop.</p>
	<p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">But it won't stop, until everything is gone.</span></p>
	<p>Your confidence drops by the day. Your very identity is shaken.</p>
	<p>"Am I really the man I used to be?"</p>
	<p>"Will my spouse ever see me the same way?"</p>
	<p>"Will I ever see myself the same way?"</p>
	<p>You find yourself at a crossroad.</p>
	<p>Everyone you trust is telling you should accept it, shave your head and go on with your life. </p>
	<p>But for many of you, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">not graced with the stunning scalp of a Mr. Clean,</span> that's just not an option.</p>
	<p>Before you found this page, you've probably looked at
			<span class="_IeEc8YIm">countless other products</span> - pills, potions and creams, noticing that they were either too expensive or too time consuming; and none had promise of long term results.
	</p>
	<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/custom/revifol-img-2.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">And dark hopelessness is setting in.</span> You don't know if it will ever go away&hellip;</p>
	<p>If any of this rings true for you, I just have one thing to say.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">It isn't your fault.</span></p>
	<p>It really isn't.</p>
	<p>You along with hundreds of millions of other men, are suffering from the exact same problem, thinking the exact same thoughts.</p>
	<p>And are coming to realize the exact same thing.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">None of this crap you're being offered actually works&hellip;</span></p>
	<p>Excuse my French.</p>
	<p>If you feel as if you've wasted your time and wasted your money, <span class="_IeEc8YIm">I hate to say it</span>.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">But you have.</span></p>
	<p>I'm a hair restoration expert and believe me&hellip;</p>
	<p>All my patients use Rogaine and Propecia. It's not like they haven't heard of it.</p>
	<p><span class="_IeEc8YIm">They use it every day</span>.</p>
	<p>And yet they're still in my office with a head as bald as a golf ball, ready to go under the knife to fix this problem.</p>
	<p>I thought I was doing them a service by cutting them up.</p>
	<p>I really thought that. </p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Until one day.</span></p>
	<p><span class="_IeEc8YIm">A day that changed me forever.</span></p>
	<p>I realized it just doesn't have to be that way.</p>
	<p>I realized that a problem that seemed out of our control, was actually very much in our control.</p>
	<p>
			<span class="_MIe9sLtV">And the 8.4 billion dollar hair industry that's cashing in this most difficult time of your life, instead of curing us&hellip;</span>
	</p>
	<p>They don't even attempt to offer a cure to this condition, a condition which is in many ways
			<span class="_IeEc8YIm">destroying our lives... by the millions</span>.</p>
	<p>I will admit.</p>
	<p>The products they offer us may have some results for a little while.</p>
	<p>But are they the complete solution?</p>
	<p>How long do these results actually last?</p>
	<h2>Here's a little secret they don't want you to know.</h2>
	<p>Did you know that Rogaine was only tested on its subjects for 5 years and then
			<span class="_MIe9sLtV">all testing was halted</span> as it went to market?</p>
	<p>Try to find someone still using Rogaine successfully after those 5 years.</p>
	<p>Try to find them and you'll see, they just don't exist.</p>
	<p>And they know it.</p>
	<p>And they continue to sell it, <span class="_IeEc8YIm">even though it isn't a real solution</span>.</p>
	<p>If you don't believe me, call up Rogaine's customer service right now and ask them if this product is a cure for hair loss.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">They will be forced to admit the truth. That is not.</span></p>
	<p>The dirty truth is, <span class="_IeEc8YIm">they don't want a cure</span>.</p>
	<p>Because if your hair loss is cured, there is nothing for them to sell you month by month,
			<span class="_MIe9sLtV">that will fill their deep, greedy pockets.</span></p>
	<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/custom/revifol-img-3.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
	<p>And by the way, that kind of thinking is what's at the head of many medical problems we face today.</p>
	<p>
			<span class="_MIe9sLtV">The medical industry is no longer interested in cures, </span>because you only pay for a cure once, but their products make them money for life.
	</p>
	<p>That's why there's so much talk of a cure for everything from chicken pox to yellow fever, but
			<span class="_IeEc8YIm">no cure for hair loss&hellip;</span></p>
	<p>Sure, hair loss isn't lethal, but per capita it causes as much suffering as any of these diseases. </p>
	<p>But now&hellip;</p>
	<p>If you aren't mad enough, <span class="_IeEc8YIm">I'm going to send your blood boiling&hellip;.</span></p>
	<p>
			<span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">What if I told you they aren't looking for a solution to hair loss because there is already a solution to hair loss&hellip;</span>
	</p>
	<p>And that solution has been known to the hair care industry for over 9 years.</p>
	<p>And yet this solution hasn't made it into any of their products&hellip;</p>
	<p>Or been covered in a single article anywhere online.</p>
	<p>Why?</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Because it's being suppressed by those in power, to protect their mega empire.</span></p>
	<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/custom/revifol-img-4.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
	<p>I really hate to tell this to people, because <span class="_IeEc8YIm">it's really hard to swallow</span>.
			<span class="_MIe9sLtV">Hair loss is one big mirage. </span></p>
	<p>A problem that had a solution, long long ago. </p>
	<p>A problem you don't need to be suffering from, because your body and nature already have everything you need to
			<span class="_MIe9sLtV">regrow a full head of hair</span> and keep it until the day you die.</p>
	<p>And it's nearly free and lasts longer than any product on the market would promise you.</p>
	<h2>This solution has been conveniently avoided by the hair care industry.</h2>
	<p>When someone attempted to make a product with these ingredients, they were beaten down with
			<span class="_MIe9sLtV">threats for litigation,</span> before their product ever saw the light of the day.</p>
	<p>Why?Because it had in it an exotic all natural compound, most have never heard of, that begins regrowing your hair within hours of taking it.</p>
	<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/custom/revifol-img-5.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
	<p>With new follicles appearing sooner than what any other product on the market would guarantee you. </p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">This was proven beyond any shadow of doubt</span>, in a study of
			<span class="_IeEc8YIm">850 men and women</span>, who almost universally achieved these results, that no other hair care product could dream of having.
	</p>
	<p>So why weren't these product creators on TV?</p>
	<p>The story of this incredible solution would have been the biggest health headline in a decade. </p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">And yet it was immediately suppressed by the powers that be.</span></p>
	<p><span class="_IeEc8YIm">To protect their snake oil business</span>.</p>
	<p>Because this rare compound, which costs almost nothing and <span class="_MIe9sLtV">has zero side effects&hellip;</span></p>
	<p>Took this 42 year old man from this&hellip; </p>
	<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/custom/revifol-img-6.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
	<p>To this</p>
	<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/custom/revifol-img-7.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
	<p>I ask you again. Why wasn't this in the papers? The health magazines?</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Don't you think they'd be embracing a solution like this?</span></p>
	<p>Well now you know better.</p>
	<p>The explanation is simple - 8.4 billion dollars in reorder sales, from disposable factory made products like Rogaine. </p>
	<p>This money, and their goons, are the only things standing between you and this solution.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">I'm no conspiracy theorist.</span></p>
	<p>But as an insider in this industry, I can assure there is a conspiracy to keep you from the true solution to hair loss.</p>
	<p>And all the proof you need is right in front of your eyes.</p>
	<p>This 39 year old woman went from this&hellip;</p>
	<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/custom/revifol-img-8.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
	<p>To this</p>
	<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/custom/revifol-img-9.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
	<p>And this 47 year old man went from this&hellip;</p>
	<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/custom/revifol-img-10.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
	<p>To this</p>
	<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/custom/revifol-img-11.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
	<p>Those are new hair follicles they've grown and total restoration of at least 8 years of hair loss.</p>
	<p>But you'll never get near any of these results, unless you stay tuned here until the end of this video,
			<span class="_IeEc8YIm">when I blow the lid of what happened here</span>.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">What follows in this video is the part where we were threatened with a lawsuit if we kept it up.</span></p>
	<p>They said take it down or force us to <span class="_IeEc8YIm">begin litigation</span>.</p>
	<p>Even though <span class="_IeEc8YIm">we haven't done anything illegal</span>.</p>
	<p>You have to wonder, why are they worried about a small guy like me&hellip;</p>
	<p>Who has no power&hellip;</p>
	<p>When they are building companies worth over 8.4 billion dollars.</p>
	<p>I'll tell you why.</p>
	<p>The cat is coming out of the bag now. </p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Their hair loss solutions aren't actually solutions.</span><span class="_IeEc8YIm">They are money drainers</span>.</p>
	<p>They claim to be the experts but as usual, the emperor had no clothes.</p>
	<p>It only takes one little child to say it. </p>
	<p>And the whole kingdom comes crashing down.</p>
	<p>And I guess that child is me this time. </p>
	<p><span class="_IeEc8YIm">They have something to hide</span>.</p>
	<p>We don't.</p>
	<p>We publish our tests comparing them to the major brands and as you can see&hellip;</p>
	<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/custom/revifol-img-12.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">We produce higher hair growth. Thicker hair growth. Over longer periods of time.</span></p>
	<p>Than any of all the 3 major brands.</p>
	<p>With one major difference - absolutely no side effects.</p>
	<p>Well&hellip;</p>
	<p>I shouldn't say that.</p>
	<p>There are side effects. Our people feel more healthy, they have more energy and they sleep better. Because when you regrow your hair, you regrow more than your hair.</p>
	<h2>As it turns out, there is a solution to hair loss.</h2>
	<p>Only one problem - it doesn't drain money out of your pockets every month.</p>
	<p>Which puts me in a unique position. <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Because for me, this isn't about the money.</span> I made my money already.</p>
	<p>Because it isn't fair that this natural solution is kept from you. It isn't fair that you have to suffer one more day.</p>
	<p>Like I said, my name is James Connor and I live in Dallas, Texas with my lovely wife Laura and my two daughters: Blake and Christie.</p>
	<p>I graduated from NYU medical school. </p>
	<p>And I was for a time, one of the foremost hair care specialists in New York. Many well known athletes and celebrities have come to my practice.</p>
	<p>For the all natural look and non invasive surgeries we provide. On the outside I was top of my game. But I wasn't really all that happy inside.</p>
	<p><span class="_IeEc8YIm">I knew that my practice was imperfect</span>.</p>
	<p>It's hard to admit this. </p>
	<p>But 20% of my patients wound up with a noticeable scar after the first 10 years. Most of my competitors were around 45%.</p>
	<p>Some call hair transplants the &ldquo;perfect crime&rdquo; for this reason. The damage only shows up later.</p>
	<p>It was a horrible cost of doing business to leave someone disfigured.</p>
	<p>But I figured, I was helping more than I was hurting, at least providing better service than my competitors.</p>
	<p>And I went on with my life.</p>
	<p><span class="_IeEc8YIm">But I was really deeply wishing inside there was a way I could help these people with no harm at all.</span></p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Lying in bed, I wondered if what I was doing was really right.</span></p>
	<p>After all, the essence of the hippocratic oath I took was to do no harm. Did I really deliver on that promise?</p>
	<p>I shoved these thoughts in the back of my mind, until a window cracked open for me one day.</p>
	<p>It started when a man named Zhang Wei came into my office.</p>
	<p>Zhang was in the prime of his life. But he wasn't feeling prime about it. And he had lost everything on his head, but the crown.</p>
	<p>He had the hairline of George Costanza and he was only 28.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">He was extremely distraught.</span></p>
	<p>I asked him about how long this was going on and
			<span class="_IeEc8YIm">he literally started to cry in my office</span>, telling me It started when he was 19.</p>
	<p>He has been wearing a hat ever since then.</p>
	<p>He even hid his hair from his girlfriend. The light always had to be off the bedroom.
			<span class="_MIe9sLtV">His girlfriend saw him without the hat one day and left him a few days later.</span></p>
	<p>I've had people who are upset but I never saw a patient so emotional about their balding problem.</p>
	<p>So I dug a little deeper to find out why.</p>
	<p>Turns out, he lives in Chinatown in New York. He is the only one in his family who is balding, including his parents and grandparents.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">It was very lonely.</span></p>
	<p>We had the procedure and it was successful. He is extremely happy now. He recently sent me a picture of himself with his new girlfriend who is beautiful.</p>
	<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/custom/revifol-img-13.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
	<p>The whole incident shook me.</p>
	<p>Something bothered me about it and I had to figure out what it was.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Why haven't I seen an oriental person in my office before?</span></p>
	<p>Why was he the only among his oriental friends, when in the United States it's common to see young men go bald as young as 18&hellip;</p>
	<p><span class="_IeEc8YIm">So I started to research</span>.</p>
	<p>I found that hair loss is to a large extent a
			<span class="_MIe9sLtV">geographical issue.</span> Hair loss is concentrated in these areas of the world.</p>
	<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/custom/revifol-img-14.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">If you don't believe me, go yourself to Egypt, Lebanon or Hong Kong and try to find someone balding.</span></p>
	<p>You'll struggle.</p>
	<p>Go there and see it for yourself.</p>
	<p>I wondered&hellip; is that all genetics or we could use this information to help find a solution, like the one I'd been dreaming off.</p>
	<p>So I looked for studies that might help me figure out why some countries had so much problem with balding and others didn't.</p>
	<p>I have a med school buddy who is a researcher for Novartis. I thought he might be able to shed some light. </p>
	<p>I was surprised to hear him say that Novartis has done a lot of research on hair loss, but most studies are not released to the public.</p>
	<p>For reasons I quickly understood.</p>
	<p>I asked if I could see them. </p>
	<p>He said to give him a few days and he should be able to get the clearance he needs.</p>
	<p>And he did.</p>
	<h2>Like a kid in a candy store, I looked that research over from cover to cover.</h2>
	<p>Then ran a search to see if there was anything on ethnicity and geography and its effect on hair loss.</p>
	<p>As it turns out,
			<span class="_MIe9sLtV">there was a large study done on this exact topic,</span> working with a large sample population from each of the major countries involved in the analysis.
	</p>
	<p><span class="_IeEc8YIm">The research was exhaustive</span>.</p>
	<p>
			<span class="_MIe9sLtV">It was a tremendous study analyzing everything from their lifestyle to their genetics.</span> They went so far as to analyze not only blood types but the consecration of certain vitamins and minerals in the blood, related to hair loss.
	</p>
	<p>The study also mentioned
			<span class="_MIe9sLtV">a steroid called DHT,</span> which in high levels, is responsible for hair loss. I was no stranger to DHT.</p>
	<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/custom/revifol-img-15.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
	<p>You see, DHT, also known as dihydrotestosterone, is a product that comes from testosterone. As years go by, your body transforms more and more of your testosterone into DHT.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">The higher your DHT levels are, the more chances you have of going bald. </span></p>
	<p>Now, DHT is not all bad, there is no problem in having a little of it. But when its levels get higher, it leads to constant fatigue, lower sex drive, enlarged prostate and accelerating hair loss.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">In basic terms, what this steroid does is it enters your hair follicles and kills them. </span></p>
	<p>You see, the hair growing cycle repeats every three to six years. It means that the current hair you have on your head is at most 6 years old. Once each one of the hairs on your scalp reaches the end of this cycle, it falls out and gets replaced by new hair.</p>
	<p>As more DHT enters your bloodstream, the worse it gets for you. DHT settles inside the &ldquo;papilla&rdquo;, the part where your hair starts to grow, then it clogs up the area and so your new hair stops growing and you start balding.</p>
	<p>Now here is when <span class="_IeEc8YIm">things got interesting</span> with the study. </p>
	<p>
			<span class="_MIe9sLtV">As the study says, the cause for all this is an enzyme inside your body called 5-alpha-reductase, also known as 5-ARD.</span> Both men and women produce this enzyme and as we get older, the amount of 5-ARD in our bodies increases at a rapid pace.
	</p>
	<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/custom/revifol-img-16.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
	<p>Now wait a second..</p>
	<p>If this enzyme is found more often in older people, then why would a guy like Zhang, in the prime of his life, would go bald before his 30s. </p>
	<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/custom/revifol-img-17.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
	<p>It didn't make sense.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">But then the study quickly showed something that shocked me.</span></p>
	<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/custom/revifol-img-18.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
	<p>As it turns out, the high amounts of 5-ARD had nothing to do with aging, as most scientists tend to believe but it had everything to do with geography.</p>
	<p>Yes, geography is responsible for your bald spots.</p>
	<p>As it appears, people from certain regions of the world consume higher amounts of minerals and vitamins that naturally inhibit the production of 5-ARD in their body.</p>
	<p>Therefore, the lower the amount of this enzyme is in your body, the lower the DHT levels are and the faster your hair follicles start regenerating.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">And all your hair loss problems go away.</span></p>
	<p>The study mentioned a special compound that taken in the right doses is literally the solution to hair loss. </p>
	<p>I couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing.</p>
	<p>I asked my friend - &ldquo;whatever happened with this study?&rdquo;</p>
	<p>He said that the study was abandoned about a year after they started it.</p>
	<p>I sad, "Why abandon it&hellip; <span class="_IeEc8YIm">that's the greatest study ever on hair loss</span>?"</p>
	<p>He said &ldquo;well that was the time they figured out how to make rogaine with minoxidil&rdquo;.</p>
	<p>I said &ldquo;you mean they ignored this organic compound that's the actual solution to hair loss, in favor of a chemical that causes skin rashes, swelling of face, inflammation at the root of hair and countless other side effects&rdquo;.</p>
	<p>He said &ldquo;yes, basically. You know how it works.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>&ldquo;All too well," was all I could respond.</p>
	<h2>This organic compound works better than anything you've seen on the market.</h2>
	<p>You don't need to take it for the rest of your life. </p>
	<p>It naturally equilibrates the values of this hormone and counteracts the follicle killer, which is the 5-ARD enzyme.</p>
	<p>Now, even though this study was halted, I knew it was my job to pick it up where they left off. Maybe this was the reason I got into this industry in the first place.</p>
	<p>To find not a way, but a solution. The solution that nature is waiting on us to discover.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">This solution was right here the entire time. And it's almost free.</span></p>
	<p>So I gathered together a team of scientists, who were friends of mine and we developed a cocktail of the ingredients that not only help create this effect in powerful and rapid ways&hellip;</p>
	<p>But what we wound up with is what we call
			<span class="_IeEc8YIm">a super cocktail of the ingredients that supercharge all the effects seen in that study</span>.</p>
	<p>So it works fast, and generates far higher quality hair that lasts longer. This is the cocktail of hair regrowth.</p>
	<p>And the craziest part is&hellip;</p>
	<p>Until today&hellip;</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Nobody in the world has ever heard of it.</span></p>
	<p>But you.</p>
	<p>My first big experiment with this super cocktail was James Kater.</p>
	<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/custom/revifol-img-19.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
	<p>He was suffering from
			<span class="_MIe9sLtV">a rare condition that caused all his hair to fall out</span> in a matter of weeks. Mainstream thinking had it that the hair would never come back.
	</p>
	<p>He was 38 years old.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">He was depressed.</span></p>
	<p>He used to be popular among women before this mess happened to him.</p>
	<p>He wanted me to give him a hair transplant. I said, <span class="_IeEc8YIm">"not until you try this."</span></p>
	<p>We gave him the super cocktail according to the parameters we discovered in our tests. </p>
	<p>He thought it sounded strange, but he obliged.</p>
	<p>Soon after I get an email from him, with this picture attached.</p>
	<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/custom/revifol-img-20.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">I couldn't believe it either.</span></p>
	<p>This turned his entire life around.</p>
	<p>He started going out again.</p>
	<p>He now has a girlfriend who's a stunning model.</p>
	<p>He started picking up baseball again.</p>
	<p><span class="_IeEc8YIm">He is a new person.</span></p>
	<p>They say the clothes make the man. But in truth, from my experience, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">it's the hair</span> that does it.</p>
	<p>Anna Barber, is a woman whose hair looked like this:</p>
	<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/custom/revifol-img-21.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
	<p>She was 42 years old. Still in her prime.</p>
	<p>And she was certain <span class="_MIe9sLtV">her husband was losing interest in her</span>. She tried the cocktail and looked at her now.</p>
	<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/custom/revifol-img-22.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
	<p>Mr. Bennett was recently divorced, going back to the dating scene.</p>
	<p>And was getting no interest.</p>
	<p>This is how he came into it day 1.</p>
	<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/custom/revifol-img-23.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
	<p>And this is after he tried the super cocktail.</p>
	<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/custom/revifol-img-24.jpg" class="image is-560 is-centered"/>
	<p>And here's the beauty of it. </p>
	<p>With the super cocktail,
			<span class="_MIe9sLtV">you don't need to cut out sugar.</span> You don't need to massage your scalp 12 times a day. You don't need to exercise. Or breathe&hellip; or go raw. Or improve all your health.
	</p>
	<p>You just have one thing to take and<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> it takes less than a minute.</span></p>
	<p>Now here's something you didn't know.</p>
	<p>Those testimonials are just
			<span class="_IeEc8YIm">the tip of a very large iceberg</span>. We have them pouring in from every part of the country and yes. Every part of the world.
	</p>
	<p>We try to catalogue all of them here. </p>
	<p>But they are literally coming in too fast to put on the website.</p>
	<p>And it all happens because we put this solution inside a supplement capsule, an all natural solution that anyone can take at home.</p>
	<p>We called it</p>
	<h2>Revival</h2>
	<div class="_oGw3aBom _3n5s4LH6">
			<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="images/products/prod1/1-bottle.png" style="max-width: 240px;">
	</div>
	<h2>This solution has helped thousands already.</h2>
	<p>A product like no other because it gets to the root of the problem, it's all natural and it's one time which means you won't have to buy anything else from us again.</p>
	<p>You cannot find a hair regrowth product that has all these benefits.</p>
	<p>Because it simply doesn't exist.</p>
	<p>
			<span class="_IeEc8YIm">We are the first to bring this to market</span>, and by the looks of it, we'll be the only ones for quite some time.
	</p>
	<p>So now it's time to ask yourself.</p>
	<p>One year from now, who do you want to be?</p>
	<p>Do you want to be the person <span class="_IeEc8YIm">still trying to figure out how to make a believable comb-over</span>?</p>
	<p>Or do you want to be the person being hit on by others half your age?</p>
	<p>The one who's spouse gets giddy to see when you come home, or the one still trying to find a good hat to hide behind?</p>
	<p>And when I talk about these dreams, they really aren't dreams at all&hellip;</p>
	<p><span class="_IeEc8YIm">These are real results</span>, as I'll explain in a moment.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">This is really happening.</span></p>
	<p>A new era in your life is about to begin. Greater than what you've ever experienced before.</p>
	<p>You will have every person you know burning with envy and crowding around you like you're a celebrity asking how you did it.</p>
	<p>But <span class="_IeEc8YIm">you will be the only one</span> who knows the secret.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">The secret solution to hair loss.</span></p>
	<p>Now there is one thing that may worry you - you might be wondering about the price of this product.</p>
	<p>So let me just turn that question back to you.</p>
	<p>What would you be willing to pay to know you'd never need to worry about your hair falling out again?</p>
	<p>Really think about that.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Would you pay $500? $1,000?</span></p>
	<p>Personally I would pay more.</p>
	<p>Any sane man would.</p>
	<p>This is your self esteem we're talking about here.</p>
	<p>So could I charge that much?</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Absolutely.</span></p>
	<p>And I'd have people lining up.</p>
	<p>But the truth is, I'm not here to make myself money.</p>
	<p>I'm retired and I'll be just fine.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">I'm here to make an impact.</span> I'm here
			<span class="_IeEc8YIm">to make a dent in an industry filled to the brim with lies and misinformation</span>.</p>
	<p>And I'm here to create another success story for my portfolio.</p>
	<p><span class="_IeEc8YIm">Your success story</span>.</p>
	<p>So even though industry experts are telling me that it's easily a $397 product.</p>
	<p>We decided to charge half of that...</p>
	<p>Bringing the price down to $197.</p>
	<p>But then I decided I don't want anyone to miss out because of the price and we both know times are tough, especially these days with all the things going on in the world.</p>
	<p>So <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> is now&hellip;</p>
	<p>Just $97.</p>
	<p>But hold up.</p>
	<p>Because during the first days of our online launch, we are allowing you to get in at an <span class="_MIe9sLtV">even lower price.</span></p>
	<p>Bringing you down to <span class="_MIe9sLtV">$67 </span>for a bottle of Revival.</p>
	<p>Look below at the order button to see if this early bird price is still in effect at this time. When the early bird price ends, we go back to $97.</p>
	<p>And here's something important.</p>
	<p>I'm going to make this entire deal even better than it is.</p>
	<p>Because I've seen <span class="_MIe9sLtV">how depressing it is to watch every last piece of hair on your head fall </span>and feel
			<span class="_IeEc8YIm">completely powerless</span> about it&hellip;</p>
	<p>I'm going to give you a package discount on

					<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">You get your money back in your account with no questions asked.</span></p>

	<p>So take your time with this product.</p>
	<p>Give it a try and show it to others you trust, so you can decide for yourself that Revival is the right thing for you.</p>
	<p>Because we don't keep anyone's money unless we've fully given you the results we promise.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">No red tape. No hoops to jump through.</span></p>
	<p>You have my word on that.</p>
	<p><span class="_IeEc8YIm">I take your trust in me very seriously</span>.</p>
	<p>I will make sure <span class="_MIe9sLtV">you succeed.</span></p>
	<p>Which is why we also provide top notch around the clock customer service and expert support for life.</p>
	<p>To help you through every aspect of this process.</p>
	<p>We're coming to a close and <span class="_MIe9sLtV">it's time for you to make a decision.</span></p>
	<p>You have a simple choice to make.</p>
	<p>You can do nothing.</p>
	<p>
			<span class="_IeEc8YIm">And your hair along with your confidence will keep fading</span>, like an old picture of Michael J. Fox in Back to The Future.
	</p>
	<p>And your life, in general.</p>
	<p>Will continue on a <span class="_MIe9sLtV">downward slide.</span></p>
	<p>Your spouse will no doubt find you less and less attractive as time goes on. And the same thing will be true for any other people you have in your life.</p>
	<p>You can go down that road.</p>
	<p>Or you can choose to join thousands of people who are
			<span class="_IeEc8YIm">growing their hair right now,</span> and loving every minute of it.</p>
	<p>They have bright faces and bright futures.</p>
	<p>Futures that look up, not down.</p>
	<p>In my opinion, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">you deserve to be part of that.</span></p>
	<p>I believe it's time you take your life back. It's hard enough as it is, without a big bald spot on top of it.</p>
	<p>This may come shocking, but I'll tell you this. </p>
	<p>If you don't do this, a year from now, when you look in the mirror at a naked scalp, and your spouse has lost any interest in you&hellip;</p>
	<p>You're going to think back to this video.</p>
	<p>And you're going to know that things could've been different.</p>
	<p>Growing your hair back is <span class="_MIe9sLtV">a great blessing.</span></p>
	<p><span class="_IeEc8YIm">It's up to you to bring that blessing into your life.</span></p>
	<p>It's easy when I show you the way. All it takes is a small investment today, that will pay dividends for the rest of your life.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">So make your decision.</span></p>
	<p>Here's what you need to do to get started.</p>
	<p>Select the 6 bottle package or any package you want, click the order button below and secure your order.</p>
	<p>Fill in the details on the next page and we'll rush
			<span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival </span>directly to your home in just a few days from now.</p>
	<p>So click the button now and secure your package.</p>
	<p>And together,<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> let's get that hair back.</span></p>
	<p>And if you have any doubts, here's the answer:</p>
	<p>Don't say yes.</p>
	<p>Just say maybe.</p>
	<p><span class="_IeEc8YIm">Click the button and just give it a try look</span>. </p>

			<span class="_MIe9sLtV">If you want to know what it's like to be the only person with a full head of hair growing even in their 70s, then do it now.</span>
	</p>
	<p>You'll never know how much hair you could have grown back if you don't try.</p>
	<p>Click the button, fill your details on the next page and I'll see you on the other side.</p>
	<p>I know there's that little voice inside of you saying &ldquo;push this off to another day&rdquo; or &ldquo;I just don't know if it's for me&rdquo;. It's the same voice that has kept you from all your dreams.</p>
	<p>There's always tomorrow.</p>
	<p>Or when I have money. Or when I feel like it.</p>
	<p>Well you know something?</p>
	<p>I've learned that the perfect moment will never come. <span class="_MIe9sLtV">The moment of success is a moment YOU need to create.</span></p>
	<p>And I believe that for you, this is the moment. If you don't do this now, next time when you come back to this page, this video might be forever gone.</p>
	<p>And you've seen the results.</p>
	<p>You'll never find a product that gives you the results like this one, no matter how far and hard you look. </p>
	<p><span class="_IeEc8YIm">This is meant to be</span>.</p>
	<p>You came to this page for a reason. Not just to spend 20 minutes watching a video and leaving. So make this experience meaningful.</p>
	<p>Take a chance on your new hair. If you risk nothing, you get nothing.</p>
	<p>And here, there's really no risk at all. </p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">So hit that button now.</span></p>
	<p>Hit it well and fill out the form.</p>
	<p>And I'll see you on the other side with a very special announcement.</p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p>Sometimes the only reason someone hasn't hit the button is because they have a few questions that need answering.</p>
	<p>So let's do that right now.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">QUESTION #1: How does Revival work?</span></p>
	<p>As I explained in the video, scientists have found that the root cause of hair loss is a steroid called DHT. This steroid is a compound of your testosterone and increases in value as you get older.</p>
	<p>When its levels increase, it clogs your hair follicles and stops your hair from growing. The reason its values get high is because of an enzyme called 5-ARD.</p>
	<p>To suppress this enzyme your body requires certain vitamins and minerals.
			<span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> is the right choice as it contains the perfect balance you need to inhibit 5-ARD and get your hair back.
	</p>
	<p>Revival is an all natural solution to hair loss. </p>
	<p>So go ahead and secure your <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> package now.</p>

					Revival is only available for purchase on this website
			</div>
	</div>
	</div>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">QUESTION #2: Is Revival safe to use if I have allergies?</span></p>
	<p>We created this amazing natural solution to hair loss so that it has no damaging side-effects on people who have a variety of common allergies, because the quantities of the ingredients inside are carefully selected to be below the allergy-triggering levels.</p>
	<p>We recommend that if you have any known allergies to one of the mentioned ingredients, you do not take this supplement.</p>
	<p>For more details please check the disclaimer link at the bottom of this page.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">QUESTION #3: Why haven't I heard of this solution before?</span></p>
	<p>This solution has been buried for years by the 8.4 billion dollar hair care industry. If the actual way of regrowing your hair would be released to the public, it would cost them hundreds of millions in losses.</p>
	<p>That's why you need to hurry and secure your package today. We are being constantly harassed by the cabals of this industry to take this video down of the internet.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">QUESTION #4: Is Revival for everyone?</span></p>
	<p>Yes.
			<span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> works for anyone, no matter what your hair condition is and age; it doesn't matter if you're 20 years old or 70 years old.
	</p>
	<p>Go ahead and give it a try now.</p>
	<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">QUESTION #5: I'm in. What's next?</span></p>
	<p>Select your 6 bottles package or any other package, click the order button, fill in the shipping details and your order will soon be shipped to you.</p>
	<p>&hellip;</p>
	<p>Got more questions?</p>
	<p>As soon as you get inside, 95% of them will be answered.</p>
	<p>And there is really no cost to get you in when you can get your money back at any time. </p>
	<p>So hit the button below now and fill out the form.</p>
	<p>Oh and for the other 5% of the questions we might not answer? For that we have experts standing by ready and waiting for your support request. You can ask them anything under the sun about hair loss, the supplement, your order and more. </p>
	<p>You will have a knowledgeable, articulate, friendly and satisfying response within 24 hours or less.</p>
	<p>So, in summary, the historic Revival is a click away right now.</p>
	<p>I've risked a lot and give a lot of myself to bring it to you. And you won't need to pay a penny for it unless you want to.</p>
	<p>But it's up to you to make it.</p>
	<p>Don't wait.</p>
	<p>You have a simple act in front of you right now, that could cause the biggest change in your time that you ever had.</p>
	<p>It could turn your life into one with more joy, more freedom, less worry and less pain.</p>
	<p>Claim that. It's what you deserve.</p>
	<p>Fill out the form on the next page and feel sexy again.</p>
	<p>Do it now.</p>
	<p>Claim back your lost hair.</p>

			<p>Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California residents are entitled to
					the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of
					the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs

					liability, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.</p>

									<p class="_MIe9sLtV">All Affiliate advertising must NOT include content that is deceptive, misleading, untruthful, unsubstantiated, or otherwise fails to comply with applicable federal and state consumer protection laws, regulations, and guidelines. All affiliates (regardless of their country of domicile) MUST be in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines, including without limitation the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”), the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (“CAN-SPAM Act”), Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) regulations and guidelines implementing the FTC Act and the CAN-SPAM Act, the FTC’s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising (“FTC Testimonials Guide”), the National Advertising Division decisions of the Better Business Bureau, and other federal and state consumer protection laws, regulations, and guidelines.</p>
			<p>Affiliates are NOT permitted to use ANY of <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> before and after photos, or user testimonials in their promotions. Affiliates may not bid on <span class="_MIe9sLtV">“Revival”</span> based keywords, use the term <span class="_MIe9sLtV">“Revival”</span> in any pay per click ads, use any terminology in ads or landing pages that are similar to ‘scam’ or ‘fraud’, or create customer incentives for purchasing <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> (through cash rebates or 3rd party bonus offers – NO BONUSING!).</p>
			<p>Affiliates must also NEVER use any full or part of images or videos (including our sales and promotional video) that they do not own (unless given permission by this website), and are forbidden from using any imagery that would imply any personal endorsement (celebrity or otherwise) without written consent from both the individuals making the endorsement and <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span>.</p>
			<p>Affiliates must NEVER link directly to our checkout pages, our discounted checkout page, nor the discount sales page. All affiliate traffic must pass through our website. Affiliates must never attempt to sell our product at a discount. This includes creating discount offer pages linking directly to the checkout. Any affiliate caught doing this practice will be blacklisted immediately. All affiliate traffic MUST come through our sales page.</p>
			<p>Affiliates are forbidden from creating web pages, social media pages or accounts that falsely represent themselves as the creators or owners of <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> product and must make it clear that the page is a review page. It is strictly forbidden to create apps for sale or for giveaway using <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> brand. You are also not allowed to create any other products using our brand name, for sale or for giveaway (in other words – no free reports, books, workouts, or apps branded with our brand name whatsoever). In short, do not represent a product created by you or someone hired by you as ours.</p>
			<p>You are not allowed to promote <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> on retail sites, auction sites, or app stores such as Amazon, eBay, Google Store, iTunes, or any other site that falls into these categories, in any way, shape, or form (this includes products created by you or by us). As well, selling products branded with <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> brand on Craigslist, Kijiji, or any other classified ad network is forbidden.</p>
			<p>Affiliate agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> from any lawsuits, investigations, claims, or complaints arising from any such violation or alleged violation of the terms above. <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> shall not be responsible to approve any Affiliate Ads. Compliance is solely with the Affiliate and the Affiliate represents and warrants that it shall have legal review of all Affiliate Ads for all necessary and required compliance. Affiliates take full responsibility for their advertising.</p>
			<p class="_MIe9sLtV">Any affiliate caught breaking any of these terms will be banned immediately without hesitation, and will not be eligible for reinstatement.</p>

											How does Revival work?
									</div>
									<div class="_zIjjj5bU">
											<p>As I explained in the video, scientists have found that the root cause of hair loss is a steroid called DHT. This steroid is a compound of your testosterone and increases in value as you get older.</p><p>When its levels increase, it clogs your hair follicles and stops your hair from growing. The reason its values get high is because of an enzyme called 5-ARD.</p><p>To suppress this enzyme your body requires certain vitamins and minerals. Revival is the right choice as it contains the perfect balance you need to inhibit 5-ARD and get your hair back.</p><p>Revival is an all natural solution to hair loss.</p><p>So go ahead and secure your Revival package now.</p>

											Is Revival safe to use if I have allergies?
									</div>
									<div class="_zIjjj5bU">
											<p>We created this amazing natural solution to hair loss so that it has no damaging side-effects on people who have a variety of common allergies, because the quantities of the ingredients inside are carefully selected to be below the allergy-triggering levels.</p><p>We recommend that if you have any known allergies to one of the mentioned ingredients, you do not take this supplement.</p><p>For more details please check the disclaimer link at the bottom of this page.</p>

											Why haven&#039;t I heard of this solution before?
									</div>
									<div class="_zIjjj5bU">
											<p>This solution has been buried for years by the 8.4 billion dollar hair care industry. If the actual way of regrowing your hair would be released to the public, it would cost them hundreds of millions in losses.</p><p>That's why you need to hurry and secure your package today.

			<p>Among other things, this policy describes the types of information we collect when you visit our website or utilize any of its functions, how we use and protect that information, how long we retain it, and with whom we share it.

By visiting this website or using our Service, you consent to our collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
			<p>This policy is incorporated into and made a part of our Terms of Service.</p>

			<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">1. GDPR Compliance Statement:</span> Pursuant to the terms of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and is the “Data Controller” with respect to all of the information collected from visitors to our Website and users of our Service. To ensure compliance with the GDPR, we have incorporated the following practices and procedures:</p>
			<p>(a) We verify that the third parties with which we share User information are GDPR compliant;</p>

			<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">2. Information We Collect.</span> We collect two basic types of information from our Users:</p>
			<p>(a) Personal Data:</p>
			<div class="pl-32">
					<p>(i) What is Personal Data? Personal Data is information that pertains to you specifically, and can help identify you as a person. We collect Personal Data from you whenever you complete a contact form on our website, including your name, email address, phone number, country, city, state, and zip code.

In addition, when you visit our Website we will record your IP address and/or unique mobile device identifier.

However, it may become Personal Data when it is combined with other information, such as an email message.</p>
					<p>(iii) How do we use Personal Data? We use Personal Data to communicate with you and respond to your requests. We may also use your email address to send you account related notices and promotional marketing materials. We use your IP address to identify your location in order to provide you with notices and other information that may be required by your local regulatory authority.</p>
					<p>(iv) Where is Personal Data Stored? All Personal Data collected from Users outside and within the United States will be transferred and to and stored on the Amazon Cloud.</p>
			</div>

This information gives us insights on how our users use our site and our other products. We collect this information by using “cookies”, which are small bits of computer code that are transferred to your computer’s hard drive via a web browser, which enable us to record the general information described above. We use this information to ensure that our service continues to appeal to our users.</p>

In these business transfers, customer information, including Personal Data, is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if all or substantially all of our business assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or enter into bankruptcy, customer information (including your Personal Data), would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.

			<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">4. How We Protect Information.</span> We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the data we collect against unauthorized or unlawful access and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. We also limit access to User information to employees who reasonably need access to it in order to do their jobs.

			<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">6. Your Options and Rights.</span> We currently offer Users the following options with respect to the manner in which we collect, use, and maintain information, or to otherwise exercise their rights under applicable privacy statutes:</p>

			<p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">7. Tracking Technology and Do-Not-Track Requests.</span> We employ certain applications that may enable us to track your online activities over time and across third-party web sites. We honor Do-Not-Track requests transmitted by Web browsers.</p>

					software glitches, server failures, power outages, or any other issue beyond our
					control; (c) any delays in or failure of the Website to operate as described; (d)
					any infringement of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, rights of publicity or
					other proprietary rights or any other harm resulting from the submission of User
					Content; or (e) any unauthorized disclosure of account information that may occur
					through the actions of any third party, such as hackers.
			</p>

			<p>
					<span class="_MIe9sLtV">10. Indemnification.</span> You agree to defend, indemnify and
					hold us, together with its officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless,
					from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities,
					costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising
					from: (i) your use of and access to the Website; (ii) your violation of any term
					of these Terms; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without
					limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right; or (iv) any claim that your
					use of the Website caused damage to a third party. This defense and
					indemnification obligation will survive these Terms and your use of the Website.
			</p>

			<p>
					<span class="_MIe9sLtV">11. No Warranty.</span> We make no representation or warranty
					that: (a) the Website will be free of errors, bugs, or glitches, or that any such
					error, bug, or glitch will be corrected; (b) servers that house the Website are
					free of viruses or other malicious code; and (c) your use of the Website is in
					compliance with the Terms of Service of any third party, including, without
					limitation, third party social media services. THE WEBSITE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS
					IS" BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER. &nbsp;WE&nbsp;PROVIDE NO WARRANTIES
					WHATSOEVER REGARDING ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR DELIVERY, AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL
					WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING,
					USAGE, OR TRADE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
					MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR TITLE.
			</p>

			<p>
					<span class="_MIe9sLtV">12. Arbitration Agreement.</span> THIS SECTION INCLUDES A
					WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHTS. You agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims that arise
					out of or relate to your use of the Website. Therefore, you agree that, by using
					the Website, YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY or to participate in
					any class action based on or involving claims brought in a purported
					representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other users, or other
					persons similarly situated. This agreement to arbitrate includes, but is not
					limited to, any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to your
					use of the Website. Any such dispute shall be determined by arbitration to be held
					in Palo Alto, California before one arbitrator. Any party to an arbitration
					proceeding may appear remotely by telephone or Internet. The arbitration shall be
					administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures.
					Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause
					shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration
					from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
			</p>

			<p>
					<span class="_MIe9sLtV">13. Choice of Law; Forum.</span> You agree that the Website
					shall be deemed based in California, USA, and is housed on a passive server that
					does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over our website, either specific or
					general, in any jurisdiction other than California. This document shall be
					governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California, without regard to
					conflict of law rules. Any claim or dispute you may have against us, whether
					subject to mandatory arbitration or otherwise, must be brought in Palo Alto,
					California. For any matters not subject to mandatory arbitration, you agree to
					submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Santa Clara
					County, CA for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes. All claims
					filed or brought contrary to this section shall be considered improperly filed.
					Should you file a claim improperly, we may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and
					costs, provided that we have notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim
					and you have failed to withdraw the claim promptly.
			</p>

			<p>
					<span class="_MIe9sLtV">14. Limitation of Actions.</span> Any claim or cause of action
					arising out of your use of the Website must be filed within one year after such
					claim or cause of action arose or it shall forever be barred, notwithstanding any
					statute of limitations or other law to the contrary. Within this period, any
					failure by us to enforce or exercise any provision of these Terms or any related
					right shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.
			</p>

			<p>
					<span class="_MIe9sLtV">15. Modification and Notice of Changes.</span> We reserve the
					right to change, modify, add, or remove any element of the Website and portions of
					these Terms, without advance notice to you. We will notify you of any changes to
					these Terms by posting a notice on the Home page of our website. Except as stated
					elsewhere, such amended terms will be effective immediately and without further
					notice. Your continued use of the Website after the posting of changes constitutes
					your binding acceptance of such changes.
			</p>

			<p>
					<span class="_MIe9sLtV">16. Entire Agreement and Severability.</span> These Terms and
					any document incorporated by reference herein, together with the Privacy Policy,
					constitute the entire agreement between you and us and govern your use of the
					Website, superseding any prior agreements between us. If any provision of these
					Terms is found by a court or other binding authority to be invalid, the remaining
					provisions contained in these Terms shall continue in full force and effect.
			</p>

			<p>
					<span class="_MIe9sLtV">17. For Residents of Certain States.</span>If you are a
					California resident, by using the Site, you explicitly waive the rights granted to
					you under California Civil Code 1542, which states: "A general release does not
					extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor
					at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially
					affected his settlement with the debtor."
			</p>

			<p>Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California residents are entitled to
					the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of
					the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs
					may be contacted in writing at 400 R Street, Suite 1080, Sacramento, California
					95814, or by telephone at (916) 445-1254 or (800) 952-5210.</p>
			<p>If you are a New Jersey resident, certain sections of this Terms of Use may not
					apply to you pursuant to the New Jersey Truth in Consumer Contract, Warranty, and
					Notice Act. &nbsp;Additional states may not allow an exclusion or limitation of
					liability, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.</p>
			<p>If you have any questions or concerns with respect to these Terms, please contact
					us via <a href="javascript:openModal('contact')">our contact form</a> or email us
					at:</p>

									<p class="_MIe9sLtV">All Affiliate advertising must NOT include content that is deceptive, misleading, untruthful, unsubstantiated, or otherwise fails to comply with applicable federal and state consumer protection laws, regulations, and guidelines. All affiliates (regardless of their country of domicile) MUST be in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines, including without limitation the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”), the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (“CAN-SPAM Act”), Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) regulations and guidelines implementing the FTC Act and the CAN-SPAM Act, the FTC’s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising (“FTC Testimonials Guide”), the National Advertising Division decisions of the Better Business Bureau, and other federal and state consumer protection laws, regulations, and guidelines.</p>
			<p>Affiliates are NOT permitted to use ANY of <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> before and after photos, or user testimonials in their promotions. Affiliates may not bid on <span class="_MIe9sLtV">“Revival”</span> based keywords, use the term <span class="_MIe9sLtV">“Revival”</span> in any pay per click ads, use any terminology in ads or landing pages that are similar to ‘scam’ or ‘fraud’, or create customer incentives for purchasing <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> (through cash rebates or 3rd party bonus offers – NO BONUSING!).</p>
			<p>Affiliates must also NEVER use any full or part of images or videos (including our sales and promotional video) that they do not own (unless given permission by this website), and are forbidden from using any imagery that would imply any personal endorsement (celebrity or otherwise) without written consent from both the individuals making the endorsement and <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span>.</p>
			<p>Affiliates must NEVER link directly to our checkout pages, our discounted checkout page, nor the discount sales page. All affiliate traffic must pass through our website. Affiliates must never attempt to sell our product at a discount. This includes creating discount offer pages linking directly to the checkout. Any affiliate caught doing this practice will be blacklisted immediately. All affiliate traffic MUST come through our sales page.</p>
			<p>Affiliates are forbidden from creating web pages, social media pages or accounts that falsely represent themselves as the creators or owners of <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> product and must make it clear that the page is a review page. It is strictly forbidden to create apps for sale or for giveaway using <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> brand. You are also not allowed to create any other products using our brand name, for sale or for giveaway (in other words – no free reports, books, workouts, or apps branded with our brand name whatsoever). In short, do not represent a product created by you or someone hired by you as ours.</p>
			<p>You are not allowed to promote <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> on retail sites, auction sites, or app stores such as Amazon, eBay, Google Store, iTunes, or any other site that falls into these categories, in any way, shape, or form (this includes products created by you or by us). As well, selling products branded with <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> brand on Craigslist, Kijiji, or any other classified ad network is forbidden.</p>
			<p>Affiliate agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> from any lawsuits, investigations, claims, or complaints arising from any such violation or alleged violation of the terms above. <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> shall not be responsible to approve any Affiliate Ads. Compliance is solely with the Affiliate and the Affiliate represents and warrants that it shall have legal review of all Affiliate Ads for all necessary and required compliance.
