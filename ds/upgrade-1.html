    <p>The results experienced are not typical consumer results and results may vary.</p>
    <p>Unlike any other product on the market,
        <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival </span>comes with a few amazing benefits, for long term users.</p>
    <p>Here's what thousands of men report after a constant, long term use of this formula.</p>
    <p>There are three major benefits of taking Revival every month, which besides giving you back your lost hair, dramatically improve every aspect of your life.</p>
    <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Benefit 1: Superboost your hair growth</span></p>
    <p>Sometimes you are in a hurry and that's perfectly fine. </p>
    <p>By taking Revival on a regular basis, you will be able to superboost your hair growth and absolutely make sure it lasts for decades. </p>
    <p>Your friends and family will envy your new looks and they'll have all the reasons to.</p>
    <p>
        <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Benefit 2: Increase your sex drive (86% of our customers reported this extra amazing benefit, on a study based of 2,000 men and women from all over the world)</span>
    </p>
    <p>This is one of the extra incredible benefits that come with a constant use of Revival.</p>
    <p>Revival can improve sex drive in men, even give them longer lasting erections, no matter what your age or current situation is. It gives you the life you always deserved.</p>
    <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Benefit 3: Boost your memory</span></p>
    <p>Besides regrowing your hair, the compounds found in Revival, also boost your memory and focus, which is something most of our senior customers find very useful.</p>
    <p>Just take a look of what other people are saying, honest folks who have now been successfully using Revival for months and even years.</p>

    <p>The truth is, I don't know how much longer <span class="_MIe9sLtV">this incredible formula </span>will be available for the public. </p>
    <p>The <span class="_MIe9sLtV">high quality ingredients</span> found in
        <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival </span>become scarcer with each day that goes by and when
        <span class="_MIe9sLtV">our partners will run out of them</span> (which is basically guaranteed to happen at any time), we'll be
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">forced to stop producing this</span>amazing formula.</p>
    <p>Once this happens, any remaining bottles of <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival </span>will suffer a major price increase.</p>
    <p>That's why I am giving you one last chance to
        <span class="_MIe9sLtV">stock up Revival</span> before any ingredient shortages or price spikes happen in the near future.</p>
    <p>This is your last chance to take advantage of this and enjoy the long term benefits of the formula that has helped thousands of other men.</p>
    <p>You've seen the benefits, you've seen the long term effects of this protocol.</p>
    <p>This special deal, that you are only seeing today, will save you from a lot of trouble in the future, when Revival becomes practically impossible to find.</p>
    <p>So go ahead and take advantage of this one time deal today.</p>
    <p>Click the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Add to Order </span>button and enjoy the long term benefits of Revival now.</p>

        WHATSOEVER REGARDING ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR DELIVERY, AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL

    <p>
        <span class="_MIe9sLtV">12. Arbitration Agreement.</span> THIS SECTION INCLUDES A
        WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHTS. You agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims that arise
        out of or relate to your use of the Website. Therefore, you agree that, by using
        the Website, YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY or to participate in
        any class action based on or involving claims brought in a purported
        representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other users, or other
        persons similarly situated. This agreement to arbitrate includes, but is not
        limited to, any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to your
        use of the Website. Any such dispute shall be determined by arbitration to be held
        in Palo Alto, California before one arbitrator. Any party to an arbitration
        proceeding may appear remotely by telephone or Internet. The arbitration shall be
        administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures.
        Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause
        shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration
        from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="_MIe9sLtV">13. Choice of Law; Forum.</span> You agree that the Website
        shall be deemed based in California, USA, and is housed on a passive server that
        does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over our website, either specific or
        general, in any jurisdiction other than California. This document shall be
        governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California, without regard to
        conflict of law rules. Any claim or dispute you may have against us, whether
        subject to mandatory arbitration or otherwise, must be brought in Palo Alto,
        California. For any matters not subject to mandatory arbitration, you agree to
        submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Santa Clara
        County, CA for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes. All claims
        filed or brought contrary to this section shall be considered improperly filed.
        Should you file a claim improperly, we may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and
        costs, provided that we have notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim
        and you have failed to withdraw the claim promptly.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="_MIe9sLtV">14. Limitation of Actions.</span> Any claim or cause of action
        arising out of your use of the Website must be filed within one year after such
        claim or cause of action arose or it shall forever be barred, notwithstanding any
        statute of limitations or other law to the contrary. Within this period, any
        failure by us to enforce or exercise any provision of these Terms or any related
        right shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="_MIe9sLtV">15. Modification and Notice of Changes.</span> We reserve the
        right to change, modify, add, or remove any element of the Website and portions of
        these Terms, without advance notice to you. We will notify you of any changes to
        these Terms by posting a notice on the Home page of our website. Except as stated
        elsewhere, such amended terms will be effective immediately and without further
        notice. Your continued use of the Website after the posting of changes constitutes
        your binding acceptance of such changes.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="_MIe9sLtV">16. Entire Agreement and Severability.</span> These Terms and
        any document incorporated by reference herein, together with the Privacy Policy,
        constitute the entire agreement between you and us and govern your use of the
        Website, superseding any prior agreements between us. If any provision of these
        Terms is found by a court or other binding authority to be invalid, the remaining
        provisions contained in these Terms shall continue in full force and effect.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="_MIe9sLtV">17. For Residents of Certain States.</span>If you are a
        California resident, by using the Site, you explicitly waive the rights granted to
        you under California Civil Code 1542, which states: "A general release does not
        extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor
        at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially
        affected his settlement with the debtor."
    </p>

    <p>Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California residents are entitled to
        the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of
        the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs
        may be contacted in writing at 400 R Street, Suite 1080, Sacramento, California

    <p>If you are a New Jersey resident, certain sections of this Terms of Use may not
        apply to you pursuant to the New Jersey Truth in Consumer Contract, Warranty, and
        Notice Act. &nbsp;Additional states may not allow an exclusion or limitation of
        liability, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.</p>
