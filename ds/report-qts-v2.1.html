                            <p>Your own hair stylist has no clue about such an <span class="_MIe9sLtV">amazing discovery.</span></p>
                            <p>And yet, once millions of brave men and women find out about this <span class="_MIe9sLtV">secret…</span></p>
                            <p>It will turn the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">multi billion dollar hair loss industry</span> upside down and bankrupt some of the biggest hair care companies in the world.</p>
                            <p>So if you’re here, stop everything else you’re doing and pay close attention, because you’re minutes away from the<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> biggest breakthrough</span> of your entire life.</p>
                            <p>Hi, my name is Dr. Robert Cyrus.</p>
                            <p>If you or one of your loved ones<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> suffer from hair loss...</span></p>
                            <p>If you’ve been witnessing your hair becoming thinner and thinner and your <span class="_MIe9sLtV">confidence dropping</span> <span class="_MIe9sLtV">by the day.</span></p>
                            <p>Then pay close attention...</p>
                            <p>Because in less than 3 minutes from now I’ll show you a <span class="_MIe9sLtV">scientifically proven method</span> that can give you back <span class="_MIe9sLtV">your full head of hair</span>, in just a few short weeks….</p>
                            <p>Without having to use <span class="_MIe9sLtV">expensive pills</span>, foams that <span class="_MIe9sLtV">irritate your scalp</span> or sprays that <span class="_MIe9sLtV">damage your skin...</span></p>
                            <p>And without paying all your <span class="_MIe9sLtV">hard earned money</span> for a <span class="_MIe9sLtV">torturous hair transplant</span> that can actually leave you <span class="_MIe9sLtV">bald for the rest of your life.</span></p>
                            <p>You see…</p>
                            <p>The only reason why hair doctors all around the world think <span class="_MIe9sLtV">hair loss is so normal</span> is because it affects so many people every day.</p>
                            <p>But while this may be common,<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> I guarantee it’s definitely not normal…</span></p>
                            <p>As you’ll soon discover.</p>
                            <p>Despite what they want you to believe…</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">The real reason</span> <span class="_MIe9sLtV">why you’ve been losing your hair</span> has absolutely nothing to do with your genetics, lifestyle or hormonal imbalance…</p>
                            <p>Instead, as <span class="_MIe9sLtV">groundbreaking research</span> proves it, it’s directly linked to a <span class="_MIe9sLtV">little known and yet highly poisoning toxin</span> hiding <span class="_MIe9sLtV">inside your system</span> right now…</p>
                            <p>And once you discover where this toxin really hides, you’ll be able to<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> stop it</span>, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">fix</span><span class="_MIe9sLtV"> any damage it has done to your body...</span></p>
                            <p>And<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> regrow a head full of hair...</span></p>
                            <p>No matter if you’re <span class="_MIe9sLtV">male or female</span>, if you’re 18 or 80 years old and no matter if you’ve been losing your hair for a month or for over 10 years.</p>
                            <p>And no matter your current medical condition.</p>
                            <p>So let me ask you something…</p>
                            <p>Have you ever wondered why some people start <span class="_MIe9sLtV">losing their hair</span> as soon as their early 20s and others still have a full head of hair even in their late 80s?</p>
                            <p>It’s almost like your hair has a mind of its own.</p>
                            <p>The real answer may be <span class="_MIe9sLtV">shocking</span> to you<span class="_MIe9sLtV">.</span></p>
                            <p>But it will unveil the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">real reason</span> why you haven’t been able to stop your hair from falling, and ultimately <span class="_MIe9sLtV">give you the</span> <span class="_MIe9sLtV">key to regenerate all your hair follicles</span>, down to the very last one.</p>
                            <p>So get ready to <span class="_MIe9sLtV">never worry </span>about being rejected because your head makes you look years older and “funny-looking”...</p>
                            <p>To never have to face the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">painful anticipation</span> <span class="_MIe9sLtV">of the inevitable</span>, constantly checking the bathroom sink for falling hair, torn between buying a wig and <span class="_MIe9sLtV">embracing the baldness.</span></p>
                            <p>To never have to feel like an old man or woman in your mid 30s…</p>
                            <p>To free yourself of the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">constant fear</span> that your partner will <span class="_MIe9sLtV">cheat on you</span> with someone younger and better looking.</p>
                            <p>And to finally <span class="_MIe9sLtV">regain that sparkling confidence,</span> you had years ago when you just grabbed your leather jacket and left the house looking 10 out of 10 effortlessly, without having to look and <span class="_MIe9sLtV">judge yourself in the mirror every time.</span></p>
                            <p>Because you knew that all you had to do to<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> look great, young and fresh</span>, was to wash your hair with any dollar store shampoo that came to your hand.</p>
                            <p>Instead your <span class="_MIe9sLtV">hair grows strong,</span> thick and dense and your head <span class="_MIe9sLtV">looks better and shinier than ever.</span></p>
                            <p>Now…</p>
                            <p>You may be feeling skeptical about this now...</p>
                            <p>I understand.</p>
                            <p>After all, you’ve probably been <span class="_MIe9sLtV">disappointed</span> a lot before...</p>
                            <p>And led to think that the only way to stop your hair from falling is with <span class="_MIe9sLtV">dangerous hair procedures or painful surgery...</span></p>
                            <p>Some<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> expensive</span> <span class="_MIe9sLtV">products </span>even seemed to work for a while...</p>
                            <p>But then <span class="_MIe9sLtV">it got</span> <span class="_MIe9sLtV">worse.</span></p>
                            <p>Because for a reason blatantly ignored by modern medicine,<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> your hair follicles kept dying one by one.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">But this stops today.</span></p>
                            <p>Because no matter where you are or how much hair you have left on your head...</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">You owe it to yourself </span>to watch every minute of this presentation…</p>
                            <p>Because I guarantee, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">it will change your life.</span></p>
                            <p>So please pay attention, because time is not on our side.</p>
                            <p>The hair loss industry is currently worth<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> 8.4 billion dollars </span>in the U.S. alone.</p>
                            <p>These people are perfectly happy to keep selling you their <span class="_MIe9sLtV">expensive snake oil products</span> just to keep you, their customer, hooked for life.</p>
                            <p>So if you had enough with the<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> shame, frustration and humiliation </span>of witnessing your hairline creeping back little by little...</p>
                            <p>Or seeing that <span class="_MIe9sLtV">nasty bald spot</span> at the top of your head extending every month...</p>
                            <p>If you are tired of<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> being uncomfortable</span> in your own skin whatever you do…</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Because no matter how good you feel inside, on the outside you just look years older...</span></p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>Or if you&#039;ve already gotten a toupee and want to <span class="_MIe9sLtV">stop worrying</span> every time you get close to someone that <span class="_MIe9sLtV">they’ll find out your “dirty little secret”...</span></p>
                            <p>And if you are<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> sick </span>of having to deal with the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">constant judgment of those around you…</span></p>
                            <p>Then continue to watch this unveiling report because you’re about to discover a scientifically proven way to <span class="_MIe9sLtV">regrow all your hair in a matter of weeks.</span></p>
                            <p>Without any <span class="_MIe9sLtV">dangerous hormonal treatments, laser therapies, expensive pills</span> and without paying a single visit to your doctor.</p>
                            <p>Because as incredible as this sounds... </p>
                            <p>In 2021, having to deal with hair loss is <span class="_MIe9sLtV">completely OPTIONAL.</span></p>
                            <p>Now of course, I don’t want you to simply take my word for it.</p>
                            <p>Listen to some of the success stories that I receive in my inbox every day, from the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">97,000 women and men </span>from all over the world, who have successfully used this program and <span class="_MIe9sLtV">restored their full head of hair.</span></p>
                            <p>Joseph Miller, 32 years old, says:</p>
                            <p><img src="images/custom/image9.jpg" style="max-width: 400px;"></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“My hair loss first began when I was 27.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">In just a few months, I had lost two thirds of my hair.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">I was devastated and thought I was going to spend my best years hiding myself under shameful toupees that made me sweat like a dog.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">When I heard about your program, I felt skeptical at first, because I tried a dozen other products with no success.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">Now I just can’t believe what I see in the mirror.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">My hair is fuller than it had ever been and my girlfriend seems to adore it.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">Thank you a million times!”</span></p>
                            <p>Roy Benson, a 37 year old who is now happily married and says:</p>
                            <p><img src="images/custom/image3.jpg"></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“When I first got my hair loss diagnosed, my world came crashing down.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">Not only did I find out that I’d be losing all of my hair in less than 6 months, but I also caught my girlfriend cheating on me with her hairdresser</span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">My life seemed like a bad movie!</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">I found myself lying alone on my bed,</span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK"> depressed and crying</span><span class="_92mE9myK"> at the thought of </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">never regaining my self worth again.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">I wouldn’t get out of the house, and the anxiety made my hair shed like crazy... even faster than before.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">A good friend of mine told me that he’d been in the same situation and he recommended </span><span class="_92mE9myK">your</span><span class="_92mE9myK"> solution to me.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">It’s amazing how this thing works.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">I’ve got all my hair back and some of my relatives still don’t believe me when I tell them I didn’t get a hair transplant.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">A few months after regaining my hair and self esteem back I met the woman of my life.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">Coincidence or not, you saved my life and I owe you lots!”</span></p>
                            <p>Alissa McKenzie, 38 years old, from North Carolina, says:</p>
                            <p><img src="images/custom/image2.jpg"></p>
                            <p>“<span class="_92mE9myK">Your formula is amazing. When my hair started falling out in clumps I just couldn&#039;t stop wondering how this could happen to me?</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">I was desperately trying to find something… anything that could save me from </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">a life of feeling old and unattractive.</span></p>

                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">No more hair on the brush. No more bald spots. </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">No more embarrassing dates.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">I don’t think I will ever be able to thank you enough.</span>”</p>
                            <p>Success stories like these don’t even surprise me anymore.</p>
                            <p>Every day, my phone gets flooded with phone calls, texs, emails, Whatsapp messages and they all say the same thing…</p>
                            <p>That this program is guaranteed to work for any man or woman out there.</p>
                            <p>Okay...</p>
                            <p>Let’s not waste any more time, it’s time you <span class="_MIe9sLtV">break free from the</span> <span class="_MIe9sLtV">hair loss nightmare.</span></p>
                            <p>Like I said, my name is Dr. Robert Cyrus.</p>
                            <p>Up until 4 years ago I worked for one of the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">most</span> <span class="_MIe9sLtV">renowned hair restoration clinics</span>, with an annual revenue of over <span class="_MIe9sLtV">100 million dollars</span>.</p>
                            <p>For the past two decades my team and I have been researching ways to fight the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">hair loss epidemic</span> that’s been plaguing the US during the last decades.</p>
                            <p>And trust me… I’ve spent enough time in the medical industry to figure out how <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Big Pharma moguls operate…</span></p>
                            <p>And eventually <span class="_MIe9sLtV">uncovered their evil and shameless practices...</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">So let me tell you one thing.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">As cruel as it may sound, they had zero interest in finding a solution for a condition as “profitable” as hair loss…</span></p>
                            <p>Instead all they want is to keep innocent people giving them all their hard earned money for a <span class="_MIe9sLtV">dangerous surgery</span> that might not even succeed.</p>
                            <p>Or at least make them keep <span class="_MIe9sLtV">buying expensive products</span> that definitely won’t give long term results, just to make sure the investors are happy and profitable.</p>
                            <p>And I should have known better.</p>
                            <p>Because early in my career, I was part of an <span class="_MIe9sLtV">elite team of physicians</span> who worked on a drug which was later on released to the world as <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Minoxidil…</span></p>
                            <p>And is now considered one of the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">most common treatments against thinning hair.</span></p>
                            <p>But you see…</p>
                            <p>Even today, with all the major advances in science and technology…</p>
                            <p>They pretend they still haven’t figured out something that <span class="_MIe9sLtV">completely rid you of the balding nightmare.</span></p>
                            <p>Isn’t it<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> strange </span>that scientists already found a cure for most common diseases <span class="_MIe9sLtV">but there is still nothing</span> for something just as common as <span class="_MIe9sLtV">hair loss</span>?</p>
                            <p>In my over 20 years of medical experience…</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">I only had one dream…</span></p>
                            <p>To research and develop the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">ultimate clinically proven solution</span> that would <span class="_MIe9sLtV">stop hair loss once and for all.</span></p>
                            <p>But before I go on…</p>
                            <p>You should know that <span class="_MIe9sLtV">99% of the doctors</span> consider receding hair normal.</p>
                            <p>And to some point, they are right…</p>
                            <p>Did you know that <span class="_MIe9sLtV">over 85% of men and 40% of women</span> experience hair loss at some point of their lives?</p>
                            <p>So this may seem just as normal, as all the doctors you’ll go to will tell you, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">but there is no way it is normal,</span> as you’ll see in just a couple minutes.</p>
                            <p>Now, if you are losing your hair, you know just <span class="_MIe9sLtV">how vicious this condition can be.</span></p>
                            <p>It will creep up on you in the most unexpected moment of your life, leaving you without a clue about what’s going on... <span class="_MIe9sLtV">until it’s already too late.</span></p>
                            <p>You live in<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> constant fear of another massive hair fallout </span>that will leave your scalp even more exposed…</p>
                            <p>And leave you going from the social butterfly you’ve always been… </p>
                            <p>To a shadow of who you used to be<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> </span>-<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> bitter and distant, ashamed to even go out of the house.</span></p>
                            <p>And it all starts with a few more hairs in the shower drain...</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Followed by an undying anticipation that tortures you</span> every second of the day and night… </p>
                            <p>“Will I be completely bald by the end of the year?” </p>
                            <p>“Should I buy a toupee or try scalp injections?”</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">You’d do ANYTHING to make it stop!</span></p>
                            <p>But then, your skin starts showing more and more and<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> the thinning slowly turns into bald spots… </span></p>
                            <p>You can <span class="_MIe9sLtV">barely look at yourself</span> in the mirror…</p>
                            <p>And then you decide to pay the doctor another visit.</p>
                            <p>You go there knowing he’ll give you another shampoo or a foam that cost a fortune and <span class="_MIe9sLtV">eventually won’t even make a difference.</span></p>
                            <p>But what other alternatives do you have?</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">You feel cursed. </span></p>
                            <p>And for good reason!</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Hair loss has ruined many lives</span> and relationships, bringing people to depression and despair over and over again, and yet, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">no one seems to care about finding a real solution for it.</span></p>
                            <p>There are<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> 8</span><span class="_MIe9sLtV">2 million</span><span class="_MIe9sLtV"> people</span> suffering from thinning hair in the U.S. alone, and yet no one is doing anything for them…</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">No major breakthrough treatments,</span> no cutting edge research.</p>
                            <p>Only an <span class="_MIe9sLtV">overly expensive and dangerous hair transplant</span> that exposes you to a great risk of a scalp superinfection.</p>
                            <p>And except that, I’m sure you’ve already tried everything on the list…</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Minoxidil </span>and <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Finasteride</span>, which<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> both stop working</span> after a while…</p>
                            <p  class="inline-img" style="width: 100%; display: flex;"><img src="images/custom/image6.jpg"><img src="images/custom/image7.jpg"></p>
                            <p>So your doctor <span class="_MIe9sLtV">kept increasing the dose</span>, even with<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> </span>the risk of your body becoming completely immune to them…</p>
                            <p>Now… </p>
                            <p>If any of this rings true for you, you should know one thing... </p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">It’s not your fault! </span></p>
                            <p>It really isn’t! </p>
                            <p>I’ve been using these drugs for over 20 years, and all the people who came to me for help are familiar with <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Minoxidil</span> and <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Finasteride.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">It’s not like people haven’t heard of them before.  </span></p>
                            <p>I thought I was doing everyone a favor.</p>
                            <p>But all it took was one day<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> to change everything I thought</span> <span class="_MIe9sLtV">was real about hair loss.</span></p>
                            <p>As I’ll show you in a couple more minutes...</p>
                            <p>Because I’ll unveil the story of how<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> </span>I accidentally stumbled across what could be considered <span class="_MIe9sLtV">the most important scientific discovery of modern medicine…</span></p>
                            <p>The true key solution that any man or woman can use to <span class="_MIe9sLtV">stop hair loss once and for all.</span></p>
                            <p>You see…</p>
                            <p>Up to this day I’ve had hundreds of women and men who have walked through my door, so I can honestly tell you that I’ve seen it all. </p>
                            <p>People<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> so desperate </span>they would give their entire life savings only to live a life where they don’t have to put<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> </span>up with<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> judgemental looks on their daily to-do list.</span> </p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">People who felt cursed and so ashamed </span>they wouldn’t step out of their house for weeks. </p>
                            <p>People who don&#039;t deserve a bit of <span class="_MIe9sLtV">what was happening to them… </span></p>
                            <p>And yet here they were… </p>
                            <p>In my office, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">crying and begging for help…</span></p>
                            <p>Telling me how they not only lost their hair but <span class="_MIe9sLtV">their self esteem, zest for life, spouse, social life and so much more.</span></p>
                            <p>Seeing so many <span class="_MIe9sLtV">heartbreaking stories,</span> I must admit I felt sorry for each and every one of them. </p>
                            <p>And yet I knew that <span class="_MIe9sLtV">dealing with hair loss </span>was and still is perhaps<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> one of the most difficult things in the world. </span></p>
                            <p>I always thought this was the way things work… </p>
                            <p>The only real solution we had was <span class="_MIe9sLtV">hair transplant, even the results often look like this.</span></p>
                            <p><img src="images/custom/image10.jpg"></p>
                            <p>But all it took was one day and this young man that walked through the door and <span class="_MIe9sLtV">turned my life around.</span></p>
                            <p>His name was Steven Perkins.</p>
                            <p>When I first saw him, I thought he was an old man!</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">More than 70% of his hair was gone, </span>even though he was barely in his early 20s.</p>
                            <p>I thought he had <span class="_MIe9sLtV">suffered from an accident </span>or had some sort of <span class="_MIe9sLtV">stress related hair loss </span>but as his tests showed, there was no sign of that.</p>
                            <p>It was <span class="_MIe9sLtV">heartbreaking</span> and I can only imagine how he felt... </p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">He was desperate,</span> and I didn&#039;t blame him… </p>
                            <p>It was like his good looks were being robbed from him.</p>
                            <p>He looked at me with <span class="_MIe9sLtV">his eyes bursting into tears </span>and begged for help.</p>
                            <p>He started telling me how <span class="_MIe9sLtV">he caught his fiance cheating on him with another man</span> and when he asked her why would she do something like that she said: </p>
                            <p>“<span class="_MIe9sLtV">You seem like an old man lately.</span> I just want to live my life with someone who doesn’t have to waste 30 minutes to do a <span class="_MIe9sLtV">ridiculous comb over</span> every time we leave the house.”</p>
                            <p>And then she left without even saying goodbye.</p>
                            <p>I felt sorry for him and yet I knew the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">lost hair won’t grow back by magic…</span></p>
                            <p>I knew hair loss was <span class="_MIe9sLtV">a hard nut to crack...</span></p>
                            <p>It had taken me <span class="_MIe9sLtV">two decades</span> to understand the human hair follicle and its patterns. </p>
                            <p>And I must say… </p>
                            <p>It’s truly one of the<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> trickiest conditions</span> <span class="_MIe9sLtV">I’ve ever seen.</span></p>
                            <p>You see… </p>
                            <p>Each hair follicle is basically a small<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> individual organ anchored in your scalp.</span></p>
                            <p>It resides in the dermal layer of the skin and is made up of <span class="_MIe9sLtV">20 different cell types,</span> each with distinct functions.</p>
                            <p>The reason hair loss is <span class="_MIe9sLtV">such an insidious disease</span> is that actually there is not only one organ that needs help, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">but hundreds of thousands.</span></p>
                            <p>And each hair follicle has its own needs, so basically in order to regrow your thick maine back <span class="_MIe9sLtV">you need to heal your follicles one by one.</span></p>
                            <p>And the worst part is that when you start actually noticing the shading <span class="_MIe9sLtV">it’s already too late.</span></p>
                            <p>Because the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">ugly truth</span> is that our hair follicles can be perfectly functional all of our life, and then all of the sudden…</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">They collapse!</span></p>
                            <p>And I must tell you, time is not your friend <span class="_MIe9sLtV">when talking about losing your hair</span>.</p>
                            <p>So in order to have even<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> the smallest chance of fighting hair loss,</span> you have to find a way to get all these tiny organs <span class="_MIe9sLtV">that make your hair follicles strengthened and healthy</span> so that your follicles can produce new hair that will last you a lifetime.</p>
                            <p>Now imagine me trying to explain that to the poor guy who was<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> just dumped by the woman of his life.</span></p>
                            <p>That his chances to ever get back to his former self were <span class="_MIe9sLtV">as low as one in a million.</span></p>
                            <p>It was <span class="_MIe9sLtV">painful</span> to even imagine this scenario <span class="_MIe9sLtV">could happen to anyone… </span>that such a basic thing as our hair, a thing that most of us take for granted, could be the root cause of<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> so much suffering and such drastic changes in our life.  </span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">I stayed up late that night,</span> thinking about his situation.</p>
                            <p>And if there was a thing I knew for sure, that was that <span class="_MIe9sLtV">his story wasn’t unique.</span></p>
                            <p>All the people that came through my office over the years suffered from one or more conditions associated with hair loss such as <span class="_MIe9sLtV">depression, anxiety or fear of going out in public.</span></p>
                            <p>And still, there’s this one thing that didn’t add up.</p>
                            <p>Why do some of my patients suffer from <span class="_MIe9sLtV">chronic hair loss</span> while their older siblings (who share their same DNA) have <span class="_MIe9sLtV">shiny healthy full hair, like their hair is on steroids?</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">And more importantly…</span></p>
                            <p>Why are there particular ethnicities that <span class="_MIe9sLtV">seem immune to hair loss?</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">It just didn’t make any sense.</span></p>
                            <p>There had to be a logical explanation for this<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> “unsolved mystery.”</span></p>
                            <p>I just wasn’t able to see it.</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">But life works in mysterious ways.</span></p>
                            <p>Because the next morning I received a call that was going to<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> change everything I thought was real about hair loss.</span></p>
                            <p>The call came from one of my oldest friends in the industry, Dr. Phillips.</p>
                            <p>We’ve worked together for over a decade at our former hair restoration clinic where we <span class="_MIe9sLtV">extensively researched the minoxidil drug.</span></p>
                            <p>Just like me, Dr. Phillips had been in the medical field for over 20 years. </p>
                            <p>He dealt with <span class="_MIe9sLtV">thousands of extreme cases</span> of alopecia and other serious hair conditions.</p>
                            <p>His work, in every sense of the word…</p>
                            <p>Was impeccable.</p>
                            <p>He was one of <span class="_MIe9sLtV">the most acknowledged doctors our clinic</span> ever had and people were lining up from Europe or Australia just to get a 15 minutes appointment with him.</p>
                            <p>He strongly believed <span class="_MIe9sLtV">the secret to hair restoration is hidden in nature</span> and not man made drugs.</p>
                            <p>He was a published author, and was constantly interviewed on national television.</p>
                            <p>His career seemed to reach the edge <span class="_MIe9sLtV">when suddenly and completely unexpectedly… he quit.</span></p>
                            <p>Nobody really understood what happened, all we knew was that <span class="_MIe9sLtV">he had a long closed door discussion with the clinic’s management.</span></p>
                            <p>The next day <span class="_MIe9sLtV">his office was empty </span>and we were announced that another hair restoration surgeon will take his place.</p>
                            <p>But even though we haven’t spoken for nearly 10 years, I was truly glad to see him again as he is one of the most charismatic persons I’ve ever met.</p>
                            <p>But as we started talking, I couldn’t help noticing the big smile on his face and the glowing in his eyes, looking at me with his fancy new hat over his head.</p>
                            <p>You see, besides being a very good physician, Dr. Phillips had an <span class="_MIe9sLtV">ugly secret</span> he only shared with a few of his closest friends… although most people noticed.</p>
                            <p>He had <span class="_MIe9sLtV">started losing his hair </span>when he was only 13 years old.</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">This made his social life a disaster,</span> no girl ever looked at him in high school, college and he could barely get a date with someone his age.</p>
                            <p>Now, when he told me he was married I was truly excited for him.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, I was curious to know how he managed to overcome <span class="_MIe9sLtV">his hair loss problem.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Now pay attention,</span> because it gets very interesting.</p>
                            <p>Before I got to ask my question, Dr. Phillips smiled at me, grabbed his hat and placed it on the restaurant table.</p>
                            <p>“Look at me Robert, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">this is my natural hair. It’s back! All of it!”</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“I have a lovely wife, with a kid and one more on the way </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">and every single drop of hair back on my head.</span><span class="_92mE9myK"> </span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">And it’s been like this for the past 8 years! I still wear the hat because I enjoy it, and the only thing I have to hide here is </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">a beautiful, shiny full head of hair.</span><span class="_92mE9myK">”, </span>Dr. Phillips said  to me.</p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“And let me tell you, </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">it did not happen by accident.”</span></p>
                            <p>And that’s when Dr. Phillips said something that <span class="_MIe9sLtV">had me do mental flips.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“Robert, we were </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">99% right </span><span class="_92mE9myK">about hair loss in our study from 10 years ago.”</span></p>

                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">“You see, it all starts inside your bloodstream”</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“Just like any other organ from your body, your follicles</span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK"> are kept alive by a small network of blood vessels</span><span class="_92mE9myK"> ”</span></p>

                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“But the real deal starts when the small capillaries that supply your capilla become </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">intoxicated</span><span class="_92mE9myK"> with a special category </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">poisonous substances called heavy metals”</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“And the </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">most dangerous</span><span class="_92mE9myK"> for our hair is </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">Thallium</span><span class="_92mE9myK">” </span>Dr. Phillips said to me.</p>
                            <p>“Now, before I move on, I need to tell you something about why drugs that contain minoxidil (like Rogaine and Alopexy) <span class="_MIe9sLtV">only work for a small number of people,</span> if they work at all.</p>
                            <p>Minoxidil is a vasodilating drug that once applied to the scalp expands the blood vessels to <span class="_MIe9sLtV">deliver more oxygen rich blood to the hair follicles.</span></p>
                            <p>Now, this sounds good in theory, but things don’t work exactly like that.</p>
                            <p>Because when your bloodstream is clogged with tiny heavy metal particles like <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Thallium, </span>sending more of it to your hair bulb it’s actually extremely dangerous and <span class="_MIe9sLtV">will only cause more hair strands to leave your head.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">A 2017 study</span><span class="_MIe9sLtV"> published in The National Journal of Trichology </span>showed that after entering your body, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Thallium</span> first migrates to everything that’s made out of keratin in your body, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">where it hides to avoid your immune system from destroying it.</span></p>
                            <p>And guess which parts of your body are made from keratin proteins?</p>
                            <p>That’s right, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">your hair and nails.</span></p>
                            <p>But that’s not all.</p>
                            <p>Because when you use minoxidil you’re not only bringing more blood to your scalp, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">but your entire head.</span></p>
                            <p>That means the circulation <span class="_MIe9sLtV">dramatically increases</span> in all of your upper body parts, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">including your brain.</span></p>
                            <p>A study published in 2017, but buried in the National Library of Medicine showed that tiny <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Thallium particles from polluted air</span> are absorbed even through skin and hair and then are widely distributed throughout the body <span class="_MIe9sLtV">until they reach the central nervous system.</span></p>
                            <p>Once the central nervous system <span class="_MIe9sLtV">is infested with this heavy metal poison,</span> your brain will immediately trigger the survival mode,<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> stopping your hair from receiving vital nutrients.</span></p>
                            <p>Imagine your brain as your body’s command center.</p>
                            <p>Once the command center has been compromised, it’s just a matter of time until the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">entire system will eventually fail.</span></p>
                            <p>Thinking about regrowing your hair with Minoxidil while your blood <span class="_MIe9sLtV">still contains traces of Thallium and other heavy metal poisons</span> it’s like expecting a tree to grow by double “watering it” with gasoline.</p>
                            <p>Basically when your body is deprived of certain essential nutrients,<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> your brain considers your hair and skin the first ones not necessary for survival.</span></p>
                            <p>So the real cause of today’s hair loss pandemic is that our hair is <span class="_MIe9sLtV">vulnerable in TWO DIFFERENT WAYS : </span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">First because it&#039;s the first one affected by environmental toxins and second because it is the first structure that our body &quot;leaves behind&quot; in case of nutrient shortage.</span></p>
                            <p>Hearing of what Dr. Phillips had to say,<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> it blew my mind. </span></p>
                            <p>We finally knew where to start to really fight hair loss!</p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“So if we could find a way to </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">flush the toxic Thallium and all the other heavy metal poisons out of the bloodstream and nourish it with essential micronutrients in the same time, </span><span class="_92mE9myK">our body would have a fighting chance to restart the follicle neogenesis”</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“Our hair would stop being plagued by the small heavy metal particles from our blood”</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“Now that we know what part of the problem we have to target, </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">we have a fighting chance</span><span class="_92mE9myK">”</span> I said to Dr. Phillips.</p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“Look at me Robert, I’ve given up the embarrassing wig I used to wear for almost a decade. </span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">This is all my natural hair and it’s even thicker than it was in my highschool freshmen year. </span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">I did find THE way”</span> he replied with a big smile on his face.</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">I was intrigued. </span></p>
                            <p>And then Dr. Phillps explained it to me.</p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“</span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">To rejuvenate your hair follicles</span><span class="_92mE9myK"> and prevent it from ever leaving your head again, you have to </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">get rid of the heavy metal poison </span><span class="_92mE9myK">particles that are </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">hijacking your body and hair”</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“In order to win the battle against hair loss we need clean up your blood from any trace of toxic heavy metals and </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">safely introduce certain nutrients directly into your bloodstream”</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“Once your bloodstream </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">is free of heavy metal poison </span><span class="_92mE9myK">and your body has enough nutrients to properly care for your vital organs like heart or lungs, the tiny blood vessels network from your </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">scalp will be able to properly feed your hair bulb </span><span class="_92mE9myK">and get your hair follicles to produce </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">new hair immediately.</span><span class="_92mE9myK">”</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“And then your body will have the power to </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">grow and maintain new hair</span><span class="_92mE9myK">”</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“It’s like they say - a healthy outside starts from a healthy inside”</span></p>
                            <p>And then Dr. Phillips showed how <span class="_MIe9sLtV">after 4 long years </span>of research and countless lab tests, he finally managed to find the<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> right combination of natural ingredients </span>that helped him break free from the hair loss nightmare<span class="_MIe9sLtV">.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“Have you tried to make this solution public?”</span> I asked him.</p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“Of course I did, I went back to the clinic investors, showed them the lab results, </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">all my years of research </span><span class="_92mE9myK">and after what I think was the best presentation I’ve ever done, you know what they asked me?”</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">T</span><span class="_92mE9myK">hey said - </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">&quot;Alright but how do we make money off this, if people only have to use it once?”</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“That moment I realized that there was </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">no real solution for hair loss</span><span class="_92mE9myK"> because there was </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">no interest for a real solution for hair loss</span><span class="_92mE9myK"> as long as it doesn’t produce </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">recurring income for the powers that be”</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“And I have lived every day since thinking there is no way I could show this to the public, </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">they won’t allow it.</span><span class="_92mE9myK"> </span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">Until I heard the news that you quit the Big Pharma clinic too.”</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“</span><span class="_MIe9sLtV _92mE9myK">You inspired me Robert </span><span class="_92mE9myK">and if we don’t find a way to do this now I’m pretty sure nobody else will”</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“Go to the last page and see it for yourself”</span></p>
                            <p>There was it, on the last page of his research report, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">all the ingredients and specific quantities he’d used to grow a full head of hair.</span></p>
                            <p>It took him <span class="_MIe9sLtV">4 years</span> and hundreds of different combinations to reach <span class="_MIe9sLtV">the exact formula that triggers the hair follicles neogenesis. </span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">It was incredible.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“</span><span class="_92mE9myK">We had </span><span class="_92mE9myK">to share this with as many people as we can”</span>, I said to Dr. Phillips.</p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“Why do you think I came to you?”</span> he said.</p>
                            <p>Now, I knew just <span class="_MIe9sLtV">the right person</span> to help us test this formula.</p>
                            <p>Steven Perkins.</p>
                            <p>The poor young man that came to my office, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">telling me his fiance left him for someone better looking.</span></p>
                            <p>When I called him, he was extremely willing to be part of the experiment, because as he confessed, lately he’s been thinning at a more rapid pace than ever before.</p>
                            <p>So Dr. Phillips and<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> I gave him the formula </span>and instructed him to follow the program <span class="_MIe9sLtV">according to our lab tests results.</span></p>
                            <p>Now, for the first few days nothing major happened.</p>
                            <p>We’ve asked Steven <span class="_MIe9sLtV">to keep a strict diary and document every step </span>along the way.</p>
                            <p>Every morning he would text me to let me know what happened and I’ll admit, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">he wanted to quit almost right from the beginning.</span> </p>
                            <p>He had been through so much misery over the years that <span class="_MIe9sLtV">he simply couldn’t believe anything else would help him.</span></p>
                            <p>But oh boy, was he in for a <span class="_MIe9sLtV">big surprise!</span></p>
                            <p>So after a few more days, Steven called me to tell me that he noticed some <span class="_MIe9sLtV">new follicles growing hair on his head</span> and he’s excited because he feels this might <span class="_MIe9sLtV">actually work.</span></p>
                            <p>We also asked him to take high resolution photos of his head every day, so we make sure we notice every change.</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Then his messages stopped,</span> all of the sudden and he wouldn’t answer our phones for the next week.</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">It didn’t make sense</span> for either Dr. Phillips or myself.</p>
                            <p>But then, a few more days later, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">someone unexpectedly knocked on my door </span>- it was Steven.</p>
                            <p>The minute I opened the door he grabbed my hand, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">shook it with his eyes looking down the floor and thanked me for all his help.</span></p>
                            <p>He was wearing the same big hat on his head.</p>
                            <p>Now, in that very moment he turned his eyes at me, grabbed his hat, took it off, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">started smiling and pointed at his head.</span></p>
                            <p>And let me tell you.</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">This beautiful man&#039;s hair had fully grown and it was absolutely shining!</span></p>
                            <p>He wanted to fool me for a second, wearing that big old hat. </p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">But his hair was all there, all of it.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">I couldn’t believe it!</span></p>
                            <p>I almost thought he had surgery, but hair doesn’t grow that fast and for sure it didn’t look unnatural as it does with surgery.</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">No way!</span></p>
                            <p>His hair was 100% natural,<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> 100% his and it had fully grown.</span></p>
                            <p>It was, without a doubt, the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">most incredible transformation I have ever seen in my life.</span></p>
                            <p>He shook my hand with both of his hands and <span class="_MIe9sLtV">hugged me like a child</span> as I continued to stare at his hair.</p>
                            <p>I called Dr. Phillips to give him the good news, then we had Steven give blood samples to see if there were any <span class="_MIe9sLtV">traces of heavy metals toxicity in his system.</span></p>
                            <p>The result?</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">There was no trace of Thallium</span> or other heavy metal toxins in his body so absolutely <span class="_MIe9sLtV">zero worries that this terrible condition might return.</span></p>
                            <p>Steven had <span class="_MIe9sLtV">broken free from the hair loss life sentence.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">His stress and anxiety were gone,</span> his zest for life was finally back and he never had to worry again about anything like <span class="_MIe9sLtV">this frustrating condition ruining every aspect of his life.</span></p>
                            <p>Even now he still calls me every couple of months to thank me and Dr. Phillips for <span class="_MIe9sLtV">what this formula has done to him.</span></p>
                            <p>We thank you Steven, for giving this formula a try and being the pioneer of what’s now<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> the biggest medical breakthrough in the hair loss industry.</span></p>
                            <p>As I was on the phone with Dr. Phillips telling him how happy I was that our research had finally paid off, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">he warned me.</span></p>
                            <p>The formula <span class="_MIe9sLtV">worked on Steven</span> and on himself, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">but would it work on everyone?</span></p>
                            <p>We needed more people to test this on, before we could validate its success.</p>
                            <p>So that night we went online and posted an ad, stating that we were <span class="_MIe9sLtV">looking for volunteers.</span></p>
                            <p>From people who simply felt their hair lost its vitality to <span class="_MIe9sLtV">people who were plagued by advanced balding.</span></p>
                            <p>But we were really looking for one common denominator:</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Hair loss affected nearly all aspects of their lives, ripping off their confidence and motivation.</span></p>
                            <p>In a week we had <span class="_MIe9sLtV">more than 70 volunteers</span> ready to confirm our theory.</p>
                            <p>Now, to be honest with you, I expected this formula to work, but<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> I didn’t expect it to be as good as it was.</span></p>
                            <p>Within just a few short weeks <span class="_MIe9sLtV">98% of the participants reported a major increase in their hair density, </span>showing zero trace of heavy metal toxicity in their system.</p>
                            <p>And that’s <span class="_MIe9sLtV">even in the people who had been told by doctors that there is no chance of ever restoring their hair.</span></p>
                            <p>They also reported a significant increase in <span class="_MIe9sLtV">their energy levels, their overall mood lifted, they were now stress and anxiety free.</span></p>
                            <p>And as an unexpected side benefit, they all <span class="_MIe9sLtV">saw a boost in memory and focus. </span></p>
                            <p>Within three months, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">100% of all participants stopped their hair loss.</span></p>
                            <p>The<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> women were absolutely glowing, radiant </span>and I just couldn’t help to notice the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">big smile on everyone&#039;s faces. </span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">The</span> <span class="_MIe9sLtV">men were more confident than ever,</span> knowing they could finally go out and <span class="_MIe9sLtV">get the sexy girl of their dreams,</span> without worrying their toupee would just fall off during their first night together.</p>
                            <p>In just a few weeks even the most skeptical ones, to their utter shock, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">started to see zero trace of hairs in the bathroom sink.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">It was clear as daylight that this formula was working.</span></p>
                            <p>Dr. Phillips and I were witnessing <span class="_MIe9sLtV">the most revolutionary breakthrough</span> <span class="_MIe9sLtV">of modern times.</span></p>
                            <p>So we managed to pull some strings and we found a<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> small independent natural pharmaceutical company in Colorado.</span></p>
                            <p>We also had to start looking for suppliers which only offered <span class="_MIe9sLtV">the purest ingredients for our formula.</span></p>
                            <p>I’ll tell you, it wasn’t easy!</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">It took us weeks until we found those reliable sources. </span></p>
                            <p>You would be shocked if you’d know <span class="_MIe9sLtV">how ignorant most of these people are </span>when it comes to the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">quality and purity</span> of the raw materials they produce.</p>
                            <p>We looked for ingredients on 3 continents.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Phillips used all his connections to make sure we only got <span class="_MIe9sLtV">top quality ingredients from certified FDA approved suppliers.</span></p>
                            <p>The job <span class="_MIe9sLtV">was excruciating.</span></p>
                            <p>We worked day and night to make sure that each ingredient would be right and that the overall mixture would have the right quantities of each.</p>
                            <p>But after over a month of hard work, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">we finally did it.</span></p>
                            <p>We created a <span class="_MIe9sLtV">clinically proven natural formula</span> that targets <span class="_MIe9sLtV">the root cause of hair loss </span>and allows your hair follicle <span class="_MIe9sLtV">to generate new hair and keep it there for years to come.</span></p>
                            <p>We called it <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span>.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/products/prod1/1-bottle.png" style="max-width: 200px;"></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">The only 100% natural blend that targets the real cause of your hair loss, and forces your follicles to produce more healthy hairs.</span></p>
                            <p>We only sourced <span class="_MIe9sLtV">the purest, highest quality ingredients.</span></p>
                            <p>The perfect combination of<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> 29 carefully mixed plant extracts</span> and vitamins into an easy to swallow capsule you only have to take once a day.</p>
                            <p>Now you should know that we only produce <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> in our <span class="_MIe9sLtV">FDA approved facility </span>using the latest technology and equipment.</p>
                            <p>Every capsule of <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival is non-GMO and safe.</span></p>
                            <p>And this protocol is very easy to follow and is also <span class="_MIe9sLtV">diabetic friendly.</span></p>
                            <p>It does not require any restrictive diets or wounding your scalp. </p>
                            <p>In fact <span class="_MIe9sLtV">it’s 100% non-invasive.</span></p>
                            <p>All you have to do is relax and <span class="_MIe9sLtV">enjoy the amazing benefits of this formula.</span></p>
                            <p>Over a dozen independent labs across two continents have <span class="_MIe9sLtV">tested this program on 3,200 people, women and men, </span>from 6 countries, just to make sure it works. </p>
                            <p>Lab tests have shown us that in order for this program to be efficient, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">all the ingredients have to be of the highest quality</span> and mixed only in these exact quantities and in this exact formula.</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">And what we achieved is what most experts call a quantum leap in combating hair loss...</span></p>
                            <p>Here’s a short explanation on how these ingredients work and why<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> they are so powerful…</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">STEP 1: The powerful nutrients blend is absorbed by your body</span></p>
                            <p>As soon as you’ve taken the first capsule of <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span>, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">the nutrient absorption process begins.</span></p>
                            <p>We combined<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> 29 powerful ingredients </span>chosen from selected locations such as Africa, Asia, Northern Europe and even the Brazillian Amazon.</p>
                            <p>All these amazing nutrients are essentials for doing two things:</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Flush out Thallium particles and other heavy metal toxins from your bloodstream and strengthen your immune system </span>so that your hair can fully regrow.</p>
                            <p>And second to nourish your body with enough essential vitamins and minerals <span class="_MIe9sLtV">to strengthen every hair follicle you have.</span></p>
                            <p>Since the ingredients are<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> 100% natural</span> and have been selected due to <span class="_MIe9sLtV">their purity,</span> your body will <span class="_MIe9sLtV">immediately start absorbing them.</span></p>
                            <p>And the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">hair regrowth and rejuvenation</span> process will begin.</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">STEP 2: Your blood is purified and starts nourishing the follicles</span></p>
                            <p>Once your body has absorbed all these powerful nutrients, the<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> healing process </span>of your hair follicles begins.</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">This is extremely important…</span></p>
                            <p>In order for your body to have <span class="_MIe9sLtV">the power to regrow your full hair,</span> <span class="_MIe9sLtV">you need to destroy any trace of Thallium and heavy metal poisons</span> out of your body and keep your immune system strong to avoid future infestation.</p>
                            <p>A buried 2014 study published in The National Library of Medicine shows that <span class="_MIe9sLtV">poor tolerance of heavy metals and high toxicity risk</span> are associated with <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Vitamin B deficiency.</span></p>
                            <p>So in order to create an immune shield for your body we selected a very precise combination of <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Vitamin B1, B2 and B6, together with biotin </span>which is often called <span class="_MIe9sLtV">“the hair steroid.”</span></p>
                            <p>This powerful formula cleans your bloodstream out of heavy metals and strengthens your white cells, so that <span class="_MIe9sLtV">your body can start sending more blood to your hair follicles</span>.</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">At the end of this step heavy </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV">metals are completely</span><span class="_MIe9sLtV"> </span><span class="_MIe9sLtV">vanished</span><span class="_MIe9sLtV"> out of your body. </span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">STEP 3: Your follicles start producing new stronger hair</span></p>
                            <p>Now pay attention.</p>
                            <p>Because from this point on, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">incredible things start to happen.</span></p>
                            <p>First…</p>
                            <p>To help you completely nourish your scalp and ultraboost your hair growth, we had to carefully <span class="_MIe9sLtV">select a proprietary blend of 10 super ingredients,</span> including…</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Psyllium Husk </span>also known as wonder herb was also used for centuries in ayurvedic medicine.</p>
                            <p>The powerful adaptogen <span class="_MIe9sLtV">helps your hair and scalp to adapt to stressors</span> like everyday pollution and enhance hair growth by nourishing the root of the hair follicle.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Psyllium Husk </span>will help your body redirect all the powerful vitamins and minerals mentioned before straight to your follicles, so that your body will focus mainly on<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> your hair growth function.</span></p>
                            <p>So it not only acts like a shield against pollution and stressors but also redirects essential nutrients to the tiny vessels that feed your hair bulb, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">which turbo boosts the growing phase.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">STEP 4: You completely eliminate hair loss and shield yourself against all scalp conditions</span></p>
                            <p>The next key star ingredient is <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Bentonite Clay</span>. </p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Bentonite Clay </span>has a rich history of being a treatment for various hair conditions back to the early days of the Egyptian and Greek civilization.</p>
                            <p>A recent study shows that scalp care is essential because it determines the health of the hair and <span class="_MIe9sLtV">prevents the diseases of both scalp and hair.</span></p>
                            <p>In other words, a healthy scalp is vital for maintaining your sustainable hair growth.</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Bentonite Clay </span>conditions the scalp as well as nourishes and strengthens the hair follicles, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">stimulating the growth of fuller, thicker, and healthier hair strands.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">STEP 5: Your entire health and wellbeing start to improve</span></p>
                            <p>The next ingredient on the list is<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> Flaxseed</span> which is well known for its <span class="_MIe9sLtV">mood boosting properties</span> and also <span class="_MIe9sLtV">minimizing hair loss by keeping anxiety and stress at bay.</span></p>
                            <p>So no matter if you eat stress for breakfast or only worry a few times per year, there is a small percent of shedding <span class="_MIe9sLtV">that happens due to stress related factors.</span></p>
                            <p>And that’s exactly why we added <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Flaxseed,</span> because we want <span class="_MIe9sLtV">stress related hair loss</span> completely out of the equation.</p>
                            <p>Every morning you&#039;ll wake up <span class="_MIe9sLtV">stunned by the growth you&#039;re seeing. </span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">And the confidence this gives you </span>and the powerful feeling of greatness you project, will make you absolutely shine among men and women. </p>
                            <p>Now, you may have two questions at this point.</p>
                            <p>How do I get my hands on <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span>?</p>
                            <p>And in what quantities should I take this supplement?</p>
                            <p>You see…</p>
                            <p>It’s difficult for me to answer the first question.</p>
                            <p>That’s because most of the ingredients used to make<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> Revival </span>are <span class="_MIe9sLtV">extremely difficult to source,</span> which makes our ability to keep high stocks on hand almost impossible.</p>
                            <p>Every man and woman that has tested <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> and <span class="_MIe9sLtV">regrew all their lost hair, </span>are asking us for more…</p>
                            <p>For themselves and for their families and friends.</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">This makes our stock run out in days</span>, every time we get a new shipment.</p>
                            <p>And you should know that we produce <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival in small batches only,</span> which can take up to 3 months to deliver.</p>
                            <p>Which means that once we run out of stock, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">you’ll have to wait another 3 months</span> until this formula will be again available for purchase.</p>
                            <p>We have to do it that way, because it&#039;s the only way we can<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> keep high quality and purity </span>in our ingredients.</p>
                            <p>Then there’s all the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Big Pharma lawyers,</span> who <span class="_MIe9sLtV">angrily threaten they’ll shut us down </span>if we don’t take this formula down immediately.</p>
                            <p>But since you’ve already watched this video,<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> right now we can promise your access to up to 6 bottles of Revival.</span></p>
                            <p>However, if you leave this page, there&#039;s just no way we can guarantee we&#039;ll still have a supply when you come back.</p>
                            <p>Now, before I tell you in what quantities you should take this supplement…</p>
                            <p>Here’s something<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> very important</span> you should know.</p>
                            <p>In order to make this formula work for you, you have to take into consideration<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> the severity of heavy metal toxicity levels in your area.</span></p>
                            <p>Then there’s the severity of your hair loss for the past 2 years. </p>
                            <p>Now, I’ll be honest…</p>
                            <p>Based on a test we made with our partnering labs, on <span class="_MIe9sLtV">over 8,700 women and men from 17 different countries…</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Looking at their blood tests</span> that assess the presence of  heavy metal toxicity in their system…</p>
                            <p>I must confess…</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">The results were shockingly bad.</span></p>
                            <p>Just take a look at this graph of the most polluted areas of the U.S.</p>
                            <p><img src="images/custom/image8.jpg"></p>
                            <p>So when it comes to how much of <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> you should take, our safe response is…</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Don’t risk it!</span></p>
                            <p>Because even if you live in a milder affected area, heavy metal poisoning can happen even within <span class="_MIe9sLtV">a few hours</span> while you are visiting your relatives from another state.</p>
                            <p>So after seeing the results of <span class="_MIe9sLtV">over 97,000 women and men </span>from all over the world…</p>
                            <p>We recommend taking<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> at least 3 bottles</span> of <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> over a period of 90 days.</p>
                            <p><img src="images/custom/image4.jpg"></p>
                            <p>And if you want to be completely safe…</p>
                            <p>Then we recommend taking <span class="_MIe9sLtV">at least 6 bottles or more.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">This is guaranteed to naturally reduce the amount of daily lost hair and also supply your hair follicles with nutrient rich blood so they can start producing new hair.</span></p>
                            <p>Tens of thousands of men and women have used <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival </span>with <span class="_MIe9sLtV">mind-blowing results.</span></p>
                            <p>They now enjoy the new life that has been given to them.</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">They live a happy full life </span>where they don’t have to constantly worry about being their true selves with the people they love…</p>
                            <p>They are <span class="_MIe9sLtV">stress free and anxiety free...</span></p>
                            <p>And their confidence levels are holding high and strong since hair loss complications have finally <span class="_MIe9sLtV">completely vanished from their life.</span></p>
                            <p>People like Richard Allen, a 38 year old, who says…</p>
                            <p><img src="images/custom/image5.jpg" style="max-width: 400px;"></p>

                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">I was skeptical at first, but shortly after I started using it I noticed new hairs sprouting up, all over my scalp.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">My hairline got darker, bald spots started to fill in and now I have much more hair on my head than ever before. </span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">I feel blessed that I got to try this solution, it’s indeed the only one that gave me the results I wanted, even faster than I ever dreamed of.”</span></p>
                            <p>Lucy Pitman, a 45 year old, also sent me this message saying:</p>
                            <p><img src="images/custom/image11.jpg" style="max-width: 400px;"></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">“My hair has been gradually thinning over the last 15 years. </span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">I have tried many things to help, but nothing really seemed to make a difference. </span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">Just 10 months ago I was at the point where I didn&#039;t want to leave the house because my hair was looking so bad! </span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">I was so frustrated and disappointed with all the products on the market which promised me results and only gave me a thinner wallet.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">All I can say now is that I am incredibly happy with the results. </span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">I don&#039;t have to carefully try to arrange it on top and in the back to cover extra thin spots.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_92mE9myK">They are all gone. My hair grew back! All of it! Can you imagine that? It’s incredible! Thank you so much!”</span></p>
                            <p>And these are just a few of the tens of thousands of people who experienced <span class="_MIe9sLtV">the same incredible results,</span> ever since we made this formula public. </p>
                            <p>Seeing all this, you understand why I initially wanted to sell this program for<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> 297 dollars.</span></p>
                            <p>But while I could have easily done that and it would still be a <span class="_MIe9sLtV">total steal…</span></p>
                            <p>The truth is, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">I’m not here to make myself money.</span></p>
                            <p>I’ve made myself a good amount of money during my 20 years of medical practice.</p>
                            <p>I’m actually close to retiring...</p>
                            <p>But there is just one last thing I want to do before that.</p>
                            <p>I want to help you and millions of other men and women out there <span class="_MIe9sLtV">to regain their identity and confidence</span> that comes with a gorgeous thick crown on their head.</p>
                            <p>That’s why I’m not going to ask you for <span class="_MIe9sLtV">297 dollars…</span></p>
                            <p>Or even <span class="_MIe9sLtV">97 dollars…</span></p>
                            <p>In fact, today while this website is still up…</p>
                            <p>You have a one time chance to get the proven formula that <span class="_MIe9sLtV">regrows your thick wild hair </span>and stops hair loss once and for all, in a matter of weeks...</p>
                            <p>For only <span class="_MIe9sLtV">69 dollars</span> a bottle.</p>
                            <p>Now...</p>
                            <p>Because I know how important it is to stop your hair from shedding as soon as possible, I’ve asked our manufacturing partner to give us permission to <span class="_MIe9sLtV">offer a discount on the 6 bottle package of Revival.</span></p>
                            <p>This means that you can get it for <span class="_MIe9sLtV">only $49 per bottle</span> and also get<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> free shipping from us, </span>for as long as the supply lasts.</p>
                            <p>Once we run out of stock, this discount will be <span class="_MIe9sLtV">gone forever.</span></p>
                            <p>So select on the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">6 bottle package,</span> or any other package you want...</p>

                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Vicious hair loss industry giants </span>who woke up this morning and noticed their bank account balance got slimmer than yesterday…</p>

                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Snake oil drug manufacturers</span> who don’t know what to do with their remaining inventory of <span class="_MIe9sLtV">cheap knock-off products...</span></p>

                            <p>Each one of them <span class="_MIe9sLtV">wants this site off the internet.</span></p>

                            <p>So the next time my phone rings…</p>

                            <p>And some lawyer is there forcing me to take this program down or <span class="_MIe9sLtV">face an expensive lawsuit…</span></p>

                            <p>You’ll be on your own.</p>

                            <p>But why waste<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> your one real chance</span> to restore your sexy healthy mane and get your identity back?</p>

                            <p>When you could <span class="_MIe9sLtV">join over 97,000 women and men,</span> in just a few weeks from now.</p>

                            <p>When you have so little time to spend and so much to gain…</p>

                            <p>Just imagine...</p>

                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">No more little hairs all over the bathroom…. </span></p>

                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">No more embarrassing looks… </span></p>

                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">No more feeling bare and vulnerable...</span></p>

                            <p>And no more masking a problem that doesn’t exist for you anymore.</p>

                            <p>Imagine not having to struggle with a complicated combover every time you leave the house, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">that’s just too embarrassing</span>, let’s face it.</p>

                            <p>Or having to deal with the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">constant judgment</span> of those who look at you like you’re some sort of damaged goods. </p>

                            <p>Instead… </p>

                            <p>Imagine the freedom of waking up in the morning, take a quick shower and leave the house <span class="_MIe9sLtV">fresh and confident in your good looks, excited to meet other people.</span></p>

                            <p>And it all starts when you select your package below…</p>

                            <p>No more strange hair combs. </p>

                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">No more ugly hats. </span></p>

                            <p>No more constantly feeling self conscious every time things get interesting in your personal life. </p>

                            <p>You have the power to<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> get your happiness back… </span></p>

                            <p>And it costs close to nothing.</p>

                            <p>Even compared to the price you already paid for those visits to your dermatologist who gives you nothing but a prescription to <span class="_MIe9sLtV">more expensive drugs…</span></p>

                            <p>T<span class="_MIe9sLtV">his formula works for all types of hair loss,</span> no matter it’s male pattern hair loss, diffuse thinning, alopecia areata or other conditions for both men and women.</p>

                            <p>Also remember that you’re protected by our <span class="_MIe9sLtV">60 day no questions asked money back guarantee.</span></p>

                            <p>And you can start being the hottest person in the room as you were always meant to be.</p>

                            <p>Still here?</p>
                            <p>No worries, I understand.</p>
                            <p>Especially given<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> the amazing secrets</span> that I’ve revealed in this presentation.</p>
                            <p>Let me answer some of the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">most important questions</span> we receive about <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span>, so you can go ahead and hit the buy button below with full confidence.</p>
                            <p>The short answer is <span class="_MIe9sLtV">YES.</span></p>
                            <p>You see, the reason why <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival </span>is so effective is because of the way it works.</p>
                            <p>Drugs like minoxidil allow more blood to reach your head follicles, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">but that’s actually damaging if your bloodstream </span>is loaded with heavy metals.</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> on the other hand, goes<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> directly to the root cause of your problem, </span>in a unique and proprietary way.</p>
                            <p>According to the work Dr. Phillips and I did…</p>
                            <p>The reason why hair loss occurs is because when <span class="_MIe9sLtV">the body is poisoned with heavy metals, </span>the first part of your body that’s being deprived of <span class="_MIe9sLtV">essential nutrients is your hair and nails.</span></p>
                            <p>Thallium poisoning is dangerous for your body and has been shown to be <span class="_MIe9sLtV">one of the leading causes of hair loss.</span></p>
                            <p>Dr. Peterson and I have identified <span class="_MIe9sLtV">26 powerful natural ingredients </span>that together flush out the heavy metals from your bloodstream and allow your body to completely recover your organs, including your hair.</p>
                            <p>Which means that if you suffer from thinning or receding hair, it is now<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> 100% possible to grow back all the hair you’ve lost.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Can I take Revival if I have allergies or I’m currently taking other supplements?</span></p>
                            <p>We created <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> for all ages and medical conditions.</p>
                            <p>The only side effect you’ll see while using it…</p>
                            <p>Will be the <span class="_MIe9sLtV">glow on your face </span>when you look in the mirror, every morning, <span class="_MIe9sLtV">for the rest of your life…</span></p>
                            <p>And know that you will finally replace that sinking feeling in your stomach when you see more hair clogging the drain, with <span class="_MIe9sLtV">the excitement and joy</span> of noticing that you’re seeing less and less of your bare scalp each day.</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival </span>does not require any restrictive diets or weird exercises…</p>
                            <p>Does not interfere with other supplements you may take…</p>
                            <p>And it addresses the real reason why <span class="_MIe9sLtV">your hair follicles stop the hair cells growth </span>in the first place.</p>
                            <p>It does this in a gentle and natural way, you won&#039;t feel the tiniest discomfort...</p>
                            <p>While helping <span class="_MIe9sLtV">your body become stronger, younger</span> and more nourished by removing the heavy metals from all your structures.</p>
                            <p>You should also know that...</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> is produced using high quality ingredients in an <span class="_MIe9sLtV">FDA approved facility</span> using the latest technology and equipment.</p>
                            <p>Now, as always, if you suffer from allergies or other certain medical conditions at this very moment, we strongly advise that you consult with your doctor first.</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Who is this program for?</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival </span>was designed to work for both men and women <span class="_MIe9sLtV">who want to rescue their damaged follicles, while promoting thicker, fuller looking hair,</span> and have been dealing with both early or severe stages of hair loss..</p>
                            <p>And for people who just want the glow on their face and kick ass personality back…</p>
                            <p>It has <span class="_MIe9sLtV">zero side effects</span> and it doesn’t interfere with any medication or diet.</p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">How long does it take to see the results?</span></p>
                            <p>The moment you begin taking <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> is when the fight against hair loss begins.</p>
                            <p>And once your body assimilates all the nutrients it needs, you’ll<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> start seeing results in no time!</span></p>
                            <p>Also we always recommend that you maintain a <span class="_MIe9sLtV">healthy lifestyle</span> while taking <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> to <span class="_MIe9sLtV">enjoy its long term benefits.</span></p>
                            <p><span class="_MIe9sLtV">How long will Revival be available for?</span></p>
                            <p>I’m really not sure.</p>
                            <p>History has shown us that <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Big pharma is not going to sit aside</span> and watch as their margins turn to dust.</p>
                            <p>They’ll spend as much money as they need in legal fees<span class="_MIe9sLtV"> to shut us down </span>and shut down this site.</p>
                            <p>This may be your last chance to get <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span>.</p>
                            <p>The choice is up to you of course...</p>
                            <p>But <span class="_MIe9sLtV">I wouldn’t wait until it’s too late</span> and this website is removed from the internet.</p>
                            <p>Also you should know that the only place you can get <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival is right here on this page.</span></p>

                                        <p>(a) Personal Data:</p>
                                        
                                        <div class="pl-32">
                                            <p>(i) What is Personal Data? Personal Data is information that pertains to you specifically, and can help identify you as a person. We collect Personal Data from you whenever you complete a contact form on our website, including your name, email address, phone number, country, city, state, and zip code. You may also provide us with additional Personal Data in any email messages you send to us, or in the form of user forum posts or chats.</p>
                                            <p>(ii) When and How do we collect it? We collect Personal Data from Users when: (1) they submit a contact form on our website; (2) initiate an online chat with us; or (3) submit a post to our User forum. In addition, when you visit our Website we will record your IP address and/or unique mobile device identifier. Under ordinary circumstances, an IP address recorded in isolation is not Personal Data under the standard definition of the term. However, it may become Personal Data when it is combined with other information, such as an email message.</p>
                                            <p>(iii) How do we use Personal Data? We use Personal Data to communicate with you and respond to your requests. We may also use your email address to send you account related notices and promotional marketing materials. We use your IP address to identify your location in order to provide you with notices and other information that may be required by your local regulatory authority.</p>
                                            <p>(iv) Where is Personal Data Stored? All Personal Data collected from Users outside and within the United States will be transferred and to and stored on the Amazon Cloud.</p>

This information gives us insights on how our users use our site and our other products.

How We Protect Information.</span> We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the data we collect against unauthorized or unlawful access and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. We also limit access to User information to employees who reasonably need access to it in order to do their jobs.

                        <p>The short answer is YES.</p><p>You see, the reason why Revival is so effective is because of the way it works.</p><p>Drugs like minoxidil allow more blood to reach your head follicles, but that’s actually damaging if your bloodstream is loaded with heavy metals.</p><p>Revival on the other hand, goes directly to the root cause of your problem, in a unique and proprietary way.</p><p>According to the work Dr. Phillips and I did…</p><p>The reason why hair loss occurs is because when the body is poisoned with heavy metals, the first part of your body that’s being deprived of essential nutrients is your hair and nails.</p><p>Thallium poisoning is dangerous for your body and has been shown to be one of the leading causes of hair loss.</p><p>Dr. Peterson and I have identified 26 powerful natural ingredients that together flush out the heavy metals from your bloodstream and allow your body to completely recover your organs, including your hair.</p><p>Which means that if you suffer from thinning or receding hair, it is now 100% possible to grow back all the hair you’ve lost.</p>

                    <div class="pl-32">
                        <p>(i) What is Personal Data? Personal Data is information that pertains to you specifically, and can help identify you as a person. We collect Personal Data from you whenever you complete a contact form on our website, including your name, email address, phone number, country, city, state, and zip code. You may also provide us with additional Personal Data in any email messages you send to us, or in the form of user forum posts or chats.</p>
                        <p>(ii) When and How do we collect it? We collect Personal Data from Users when: (1) they submit a contact form on our website; (2) initiate an online chat with us; or (3) submit a post to our User forum. In addition, when you visit our Website we will record your IP address and/or unique mobile device identifier. Under ordinary circumstances, an IP address recorded in isolation is not Personal Data under the standard definition of the term. However, it may become Personal Data when it is combined with other information, such as an email message.</p>
                        <p>(iii) How do we use Personal Data? We use Personal Data to communicate with you and respond to your requests. We may also use your email address to send you account related notices and promotional marketing materials. We use your IP address to identify your location in order to provide you with notices and other information that may be required by your local regulatory authority.</p>
                        <p>(iv) Where is Personal Data Stored? All Personal Data collected from Users outside and within the United States will be transferred and to and stored on the Amazon Cloud.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>(b) General Information:&nbsp;&nbsp;General Information consists of information that is anonymous in nature and does not identify you as an individual. &nbsp;This includes your computer IP address, unique mobile device identifier, browser type, ISP or carrier name, and the URL of the last web page you visited before visiting our website. This information gives us insights on how our users use our site and our other products. We collect this information by using “cookies”, which are small bits of computer code that are transferred to your computer’s hard drive via a web browser, which enable us to record the general information described above. We use this information to ensure that our service continues to appeal to our users.</p>
                    <p>(i) How do we use General Information?&nbsp; General Information gives us insights on how people use the Service, and helps us to maintain, modify, and enhance it.&nbsp;We use cookies to help us customize your experience when using the Service.

How We Protect Information.</span> We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the data we collect against unauthorized or unlawful access and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.

                <p>Affiliates are NOT permitted to use ANY of <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> before and after photos, or user testimonials in their promotions. Affiliates may not bid on <span class="_MIe9sLtV">“Revival”</span> based keywords, use the term <span class="_MIe9sLtV">“Revival”</span> in any pay per click ads, use any terminology in ads or landing pages that are similar to ‘scam’ or ‘fraud’, or create customer incentives for purchasing <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span> (through cash rebates or 3rd party bonus offers – NO BONUSING!).</p>
                <p>Affiliates must also NEVER use any full or part of images or videos (including our sales and promotional video) that they do not own (unless given permission by this website), and are forbidden from using any imagery that would imply any personal endorsement (celebrity or otherwise) without written consent from both the individuals making the endorsement and <span class="_MIe9sLtV">Revival</span>.</p>
